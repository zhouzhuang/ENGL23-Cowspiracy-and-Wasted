“I love animals, which is why I’m in the meat industry”. I’m sorry, what was that? When I heard this statement, it summed up the actions of all the organizations that Kip interviewed at the beginning of the film . Not a single organization was willing to admit that the cow and livestock industry was contributing to such terrible effects for our planet. Even if they didn’t know (which is surprising, given they are at such high positions of power in these organizations) they did not even care to admit that it was maybe something that had been overlooked or was a possibility. This film was very interestingly done, because it asked a lot of pressing questions and held these organizations that we so blindly hold as “doing the noble thing” accountable. It was surprising to see just how many organizations were not necessarily identifying the issue of climate change as we thought it to be relevant. The many statistics really put the entire issue into perspective (though at times, overwhelming). I thought the slaughter being shown was a very powerful moment to include, and even did a very good job in convincing me to potentially transition from vegetarian to potentially all vegan. I would highly recommend this film to many of my meat-loving friends and hope that it’ll change their mind.

Something else that got the same reaction out of me was when the lady from the pro-agriculture group said that animals like it more in the factory style, multilevel farms they are subjects to nowadays, claiming better access to "individualized care." To me that just makes no sense. They are actually living in cages, where they can't even move and yet they are happier. Just like many others, I too felt the frustration when Kip Anderson couldn't get interviews or answers from some of the environmental agencies. Like you mentioned, Kip asks the questions that seriously matter to the organizations that are seemingly righteous, exposing them in a way. It was interesting to see these organizations stumbling and struggling to answer seemingly simple questions about climate change.  I enjoyed this approach but we saw of the possible consequences when it got to the part about activists in Brazil being murdered, it was pretty scary. I believe it was 1100 activists that died and knowing that, many are encouraged to go silent. This is troubling, especially in Brazil where the Amazon is being destroyed. Without activists it will only get worse.

I agree that the irony in that statement from the ranchers is a bit hard to wrap our heads around. How is it possible to ethically or morally justify killing animals for food when we know it's not necessary for survival? It's really hard to say, I think it relates to the key ideas from the climate change deniers. Our actions are reflections of our social and cultural identities. People won't want to change their behavior if they think it is going to change who they are. How can you be a rancher if you're vegan? etc. I thought it was really cool that they had the former rancher basically say that you can't be an environmentalist if you eat animal products.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you on how crazy it was that not a single organization was willing to admit that the animal agriculture business is such a huge environmental burden. These are the people that are supposed to be honestly fighting for a better earth, and here they are ignoring a huge issue in part because it would hurt the amount of funding they get. I think it is so sad that people are so unwilling to change their habits even when they cause millions of people to suffer because of climate change, not to mention the suffering of billions of animals. With the amount of food we waste, it is shameful of us and wrong to subject these animals to a life of suffering all so we can slaughter them, cook them, and then throw them away because ⅓ of food gets wasted in the US. I have been a vegetarian for 9 months now and luckily it has been much easier because of the growing number of vegetarian friendly products in restaurants and stores, but I still hate the amount of stigma behind being a vegan or vegetarian. Vegans especially get made fun of all the time and they get trash talked, when they're the ones being brave and doing the right thing. When I first became a vegetarian, people around me would try to convince me that I wouldn’t get enough nutrients and I wouldn’t be able to function as properly, but after learning more information I know that this is completely untrue. Humans are at their healthiest when they eat plant based diets and you can get even more nutrients and yes protein all from plants. I also have seen the documentary “What the Health” and it explained that cow milk has one purpose- to turn a small calf into a HUGE COW. They describe it as baby cow growth hormone and most humans are lactose intolerant for a reason. Being a vegetarian is so easy, especially with all the different plant based “meat” options that are out there. As Thoreau says in “Walden”, look at the powerful Oxen that eats only plants yet can still pull the plow for hours on end. I think that more people must realize what an impact eating meat has on the planet and hopefully this will stir people into action.

Animal agriculture is a major contributor of greenhouse emissions. What we both find interesting is the fact that these organizations in the meat industry are reluctant to acknowledge the negative effects they are placing on our environment. Most of these organizations have not made any steps to change their practices as well. It is ironic that they "love" animals, yet kill them everyday and release CO2 into our atmosphere. When people eat meat everyday they do not think about the factors that go into making and processing the meat. Even if they do, it is hard to completely cut meat out of your diet. Something that everyone can do is try to eat less meat every day and week. Also, there is the option of a plan-rich diet or a completely plant-based diet. Transitioning to plant based food reduces ones carbon footprint and has health benefits. The slaughter of the cattle scene was eye-opening and made me feel bad for the animals and the environment. Personally, I still eat meat but am making efforts to reduce my meat consumption. We need to make these transitions for our environment, our health, and our Earth.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment and as I also found that persons statement very uneducated. Like you mentioned these people are not willing to own up to what they are doing for various reasons. The film mentions that 18% of greenhouse gas emissions come from animal agriculture and these people somehow fail to see understand these facts. I also found the film very interesting as it shows how the meat industry is harming our environment and how these large corporations are failing to recognize this because of how much money they are making. Throughout the film many facts and statistics are mentioned in regards to greenhouse gas emissions and the meat industry. However this film was released in 2014 and since then these numbers have changed for the worse unfortunately. I remember reading that the percentage of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock could go up to 60% by 2050, which is absolutely insane.
<br><hr>
Although Cowspiracy had some false information, I would agree that it was very eye opening.  The fact that the film was based on an errored statistic claiming animal productions are responsible for 50% of greenhouse gasses (when it was really just 15%) made me very skeptical about the film and what it presented.  However, the film was still very interesting in providing a new perspective on the damage that the meat industry does to the environment, and how we can mitigate this damage by switching to a largely plant based diet.  However, I think the film is a little too radical to show to most of the people I know.  In addition, the false statistics really hurts the film's credibility as I know that more conservative people will instantly use the film's error to discredit the value of the film.   I much prefer Ken's insight on the meat industry, and his solution of switching to a plant-based diet versus having to switch to a full vegetarian diet.  Ken's solution is much less radical and much more realistic as a largely plant-based diet is also very healthy and much easier to achieve than going the whole way.  Much of my immediate family was pescatarian for a time (couple years) until my mother, who is a pharmacist, realized that meat has very valuable nutrients.  She now suggests that instead of a pescatatian diet, we eat some meat but only as a very small portion of our diet.  Therefore, not only is a largely plant-based diet good for the environment, but it is optimal for health.

I have to agree with you Nikita Gupta, that statement was just really ironic. It really frustrates me to know that these corporations are quiet about the situation at hand. They are just doing it for the money but don’t these corporations know that without a planet there will be no money. I admire Kip Anderson for continuing the documentary knowing that advocates have been murdered for speaking up. When he mentioned that agriculture is accountable for fifty- one percent of CO2 emissions I was really shocked but luckily Ken made it clear that it is only accountable for fifteen percent. The part of the duck being slaughtered was really gruesome, I feel like Kip put this in the documentary because he wanted to get people to see that this happens to all the animals we eat. It really makes me feel different when I have to see an animal being slaughtered, but it is so easy for us to eat meat because we do not see the behind the scenes. I am kind of relieved that knowing that eating meat is not the worst but wasting food is. I feel like I do not waste food, I tried to eat everything I make and if I do not finish it I save it for later.

I thought the same thing when I heard those meat farmers say "I love animals, which is why I'm in the meat industry." I don't understand that reasoning. I don’t understand how someone could be a dairy or beef farmer. I just don't work like that. Regardless of environmental impact, I don’t think I could morally wake up and do that everyday to those helpless animals. I would get too emotionally connected to the cows. Sure they treat them well, but they are still being kept and killed against their will. The dairy farm images alone were very difficult for me to watch. When I was watching the fishing scenes, it was hard to keep my eyes on the screen. The thought that kept coming up during the fishing was that this isn't our place to be doing these things. We should not be altering these oceanic ecosystems the way we are. It is not fair to the animals, and it doesn't help the planet in any way. 
<br><br>
There were a few facts that surprised me in this documentary. The fact that raising cattle emits more greenhouse gasses than the entire transportation sector (cars, buses, trains, boats, and planes combined) is shocking to me. The amount of damage we could reduce just by not eating beef is astonishing. And yet, we are so far from achieving that goal. The next fact was that raising livestock emits 34 trillion gallons of water per year. Fracking is 100 billion gallons per year. I had no idea that it took THAT much water. The things we could do with that water instead of raise animals for food. I mean some cities in the U.S. don't have clean water for christ sake.The last one was 1 quarter pound hamburger requires about 660 gallons of water to produce, roughly two months of showering. Two months of showering for one burger. Unbelievable.

When the grass-fed farmer said that they are in the meat industry because they love animals, I lost it. I had to pause the movie and my immediate response was, "What the f*ck??" Aside from this interesting scene, I was quite surprised to see that many of the claimed climate activist groups did not mention anything about how livestock industry is impacting our planet terribly. I was even more surprised that many of the directors or heads of the climate groups did not know of how terrible the consequences are of having such a large livestock industry. Lastly, I agree with you that the statistics really put everything into perspective for me. The statistics that really stuck to me were those that showcased the energy conversions for the duck. When I saw that the man had taken matter into his own hands and taken up backyard farming, I though, "Wow this seems like a better alternative. Only eat meat that you are able to kill on your own." But once I saw the conversion rate (100 pounds of feed for 1 pound of duck meat), eating meat is not practical anymore if we want this world to change. 
<br><br>

As a meat eater myself, watching this film (in addition to the lectures and other films) has convinced me to move away from my 1/7th commitment to vegetarianism by having "Meatless Mondays" and transitioning into a vegetarian lifestyle (and eventually all vegan).




<br><hr>

It is important. I really agree with you. Based on a simple biology rule, the energy pyramid, the efficiency of transfer energy from one level to the upper level is only 10% of the original level. If the grass, fodder, and other plants are the primary consumer, the cow, chickens, and other animals are the secondary consumers. Thus, people, who eat a lot of meat become the third consumer. However, if we can direct eat the plant, we can save 90% energy. Thus, we can reduce a lot of CO2 emissions. 

<br><br>

This documentary is really famous. The director uses the pathos and logos to persuade the audience. This will be really helpful the plant-eating movement




<br><hr>

I think this was a good opportunity to open up the discussion on potential corruption in the ES industry. While true, the environmental studies field prides itself in finding the newest ways that we can save the planet, I found it too odd that so many well known organizations would not even acknowledge the issue, that there was this sort of black cloud around it. While true, it could easily be because of fear of what those in charge of such big industries can do, I also think there definitely is some stuff going on behind the scenes. I wonder if Al Gore or any of the other big environmental names perhaps were told not to speak out against the meat industry. I also agree that showing the slaughter was almost definitely included as a means to disgust the viewer into start shifting away from meat products. As a long time former vegan myself, it was graphic content like that, that made it easier to switch to alternatives as I don't think anyone was trying to see that duck lose its head.

This documentary was … Surprising. The sheer number of cultivated livestock seemed almost gross. Its eye opening because that’s what it takes to feed our monstrous population. After watching this film, I remember when I watched this Life After Food documentary where someone went on a soylent only diet. Soylent is a food replacement that would serve as a successful backup option if the world's animal agriculture system vanished. It is a very severe Plan B, but if the environment and animal's lifespan took a turn for the worst, it would ensure the survival of humans. 
<br><br>
Anyways, Cowspiracy effectively used persuasion methods by a credible source, a logical argument, and to the right audience. I am a heavy meat-eater, and now I feel some remorse or guilt over my diet habits. Thinking about it, I probably eat more meat than most Americans, and if Americans eat the biggest volume of beef, than my carbon footprint diet is one of the biggest on the planet. Even though I do not plan on going vegetarian, I can definitely slow down on the protein part of my meals. The name of the documentary was cleaver and justifiable, and I would definitely recommend this film to other friends who eat the way I do.



<br><hr>
I agree with you that I was surprised to see all those seemingly environmental organizations be “responsible” regards to what they do. Also, they do not admit the issues of food production, and waste as one of the most devastating factors regards climate crisis. I’m disappointed. Animal agriculture requires a tremendous amount of water consumption, which leads to deforestation, human intervention of logging, and agribusiness. However, the government and organizations ignore the fact of harmful consequences brought from food production and waste. It is an unsustainable source so that we should begin to change our culture of meat-based diet into a plant-based diet. I also think that there is a problem with people’s stereotypes of meat as the primary protein products, while a lot of other food like beans and lentils can provide enough nutrition we need. It’s hard to change meat-lovers’ diet, but it’s possible to limit some meat intakes since we are not necessarily to eat meat every single day.

<br><br>

Moreover, a plant-based diet is said to be more healthy. Personally, when I first came to the states, I was surprised by the meat consumptions while I used to eat more vegetables than meat back home. The vegetable choices in the states are limited more to the three main types: broccoli, lettuce, and spinach. However, in China, there are tons of more choices of vegetables, which I also feel more healthy to eat more fresh vegetables. I always eat tons of vegetables when I go back home because there are not many vegetable choices in America.

I find Kip Andersen to be a difficult person to watch because he seems to overdramatize things in a way that looks cheesy. By the end of the documentary I was able to get over it since he was giving good facts for the most part and the numbers he was providing seemed accurate to what we had already been learning. But it was also really difficult to see people lack courage to speak out about these injustices though there were some good examples of people who really did know the truth but unfortunately weren't the people to step up and do the right thing. I appreciated the documentary for its informative nature of it though.




<br><hr>
I agree with you that it is terrible that not a single “green” organization was willing to admit the damage made by the livestock industry. Even though this documentary has some information that is not correct, it still points out the main issue of meat industry. As Ken said in the video, “we required a cultural change.” Because those organizations need to raise their funds from supporters, they intentionally overlooked the effects caused by the animal and livestock industry. What they are thinking is not how to mitigate the climate crisis, but how to make more profit. In addition, this documentary is really persuasive which it is convincing me to switch to a plant-based diet, and I would try to convince my family as well.





<br><hr>
I agree with your opinion. No organization wants to acknowledge that the dairy and livestock industries have had such a terrible impact on our planet. The film mentions that 18% of greenhouse gas emissions come from animal husbandry. Ironically, they "love" animals, but they kill them every day and release carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. What makes me even more surprised is that many climate team leaders or heads do not know how terrible the consequences of having such a large livestock industry will be. Personally, I'm still eating meat, but I'm working to reduce it. We need to make these changes for our environment, health and the planet. I think reducing waste is a more important step.

I am a meat loving person and I did think about switching to a plant based diet after watching Cowspiracy. I do agree that the documentary was very effective with trying to prove how bad the beef industry and animal agriculture are for our planet, however using false information was a very alarmist tactic and his work will be discredited by many people. It did anger me when organizations such as GreenPeace didn't want to be interviewed because they knew what was going on, yet didn't want to act. The beef industry is so powerful that they probably paid these organizations to keep quiet about what is actually happening and who would blame them for accepting it? They were probably bribed with hundreds of millions of dollars just so that this issue can be kept silent. Having the gruesome scenes were indeed very effective, however the part that really astonished me was when Dorothy Stang, the environmentalist that was speaking out about cattle ranching and the negative effects it had to our environment, was gunned down in Brazil and it showed her dead body on the floor. The film made me want to take action, however this scene really intimidated me because I'm not ready to die especially when so many people still think that global warming is not an issue. If people are so quick to believe anything such as when they were told that desertification was due to elephants and that they should be killed, then why can't people believe that animal agriculture is such a bad thing for us and for the environment?




<br><hr>
I was appalled to learn the extent to which the animal agriculture industry hides their impact on the world to the public through lobbying as well. Although we shouldn't be surprised at this point anymore to the degree industries misinform the public, I was sorry to learn that the same applies to the meat industry. I agreed that the slaughter included was certainly a lot, and made me consider what I eat on a daily basis, but the truth is I am still going to eat meat, while I am trying to eat much less. I wish it was easier to be vegan but I cant imagine cutting meat out entirely even as slaughter is so disgusting. I definitely will recommend this film to friends but it certainly is not the easiest to digest.




<br><hr>

I agree with you.  It is difficult for corporations working in the meat and cow industry to admit to something like that.  If they were to admit it then they would begin to lose buisness.  People would begin to see the truth especially if it were told by the companies and industries that are the ones producing the meat, and growing the live stock.  Not only does it negatively affect the environment through a climate aspect but it also affects it by using crazy amounts of water.  2500 gallons of water are used to produce a single pound of beef!  This is insane to me, how is it possible that one single pound of beef uses 2500 gallons of water.  This is definitely contributing to the climate crisis in one of the worst possible ways.  There are so many facts and statistics that show if we were to change our diets to strictly plant based, it would definitely cut our carbon footprint by so much.  After seeing this film it made me realize how much our meat consumption is actually contributing to the climate crisis, and not by a little bit but by a lot.  Although it would be very difficult to switch to a plant based diet because burgers are so good, but if it has to be done to save the planet then we should be able to and we should do it.

When I saw the movie title, I thought it was about an emotional story. The cows were used as the background to connect with people. But the movie is about something about ecology and a high value about sustainable development. I thought it was It will be very abstract and blunt, and give me a visual impact. For example, the disaster film of the torrent and tsunami disaster is not only visually obvious, but obviously it is not so old-fashioned. The background it tells is very realistic. It will intuitively direct us through the perspective of the photographer. To quantify the future environment to me, for me, the many mentions of social organizations or national organizations in the film are that the avoidance of animal husbandry is the most important reason for disrupting ecological balance. Chilling, but the political background that they drove behind reminds me of the high school economic foundation that determines that the superstructure economy affects politics to a certain extent. So there is a saying in the film that the right thing is offensive to some political colors. It ’s illegal to break the law, but to change our behavior from another perspective Things are really difficult, just like my own favorite is the bowl of braised pork made by my mother. So in fact, we must change our existing behaviors to a certain extent for the sustainable development of the future. Many people have no choice. Thinking about life from such a high angle is the same with me, so I think the will of the organization also comes from people and I am more willing to accept things that are trivial and painless. Of course, it is worth mentioning. I do n’t admire the courage and insight of the photographer to change my own behavior. I feel that it is a long way to go and suddenly understand that the title of the film is an unspeakable secret. Maybe it is an act in which we ca n’t face our hearts immediately and know not to eat meat. May be more effective for the world, but the idea and the fulfillment are two different latitudes. What I can do is to eat less piece of meat from this moment.



<br><hr>

I also agree because these people should be held accountable and the movie showed it well that they were being held accountable.Watching the movie, I felt a strong sense of disbelief replaced with anger. Throughout the film were instances in which the people higher up on the social food chain were able to do such atrocious things is insane. I had never really paid attention to what it took in the production of my food and the production of red meat. Even though the producer was wrong about the statistic with the production of this red meat being 50% which in reality its 15%, this is still a significant number. 15% of emissions coming from just one industry is something that we should look into and be more wary of what we're doing to put out emissions. This in turn leads to turning to a largely plant based diet which in turn would put out less emissions. 1 pound of beef is as much emissions as 30 pounds of lentils as stated in previous videos. This shows that by switching to this type of diet would be much more beneficial in decreasing our emissions and would also help the health of humankind.

I was also shocked by that statement made by the pig farmer. Those young kids are being raised in an environment where they become attached to these animals and then watch them die. I can't imagine an upbringing that devalued life to such an extreme extent. I have never understood hunting because it always shocked me that some people could watch the life drain from an animal's eyes, and their immediate emotion is joy and validation? Having zero empathy for another living being is a somewhat disturbing quality for a human to possess. Speaking of disturbing human qualities...It is hard to imagine joining an organization designed to help the environment but being so willing to let lobbyists put words in your mouth when you know they're false. I have so much respect for the guy who left and raised awareness about the effects of agriculture. One thing that really also really disturbing was that agribusinesses hire people to literally murder activists. I know all the free-market capitalists always come to defend businesses for "morally ambiguous" practices but I'd love to see someone defend the literal murdering of peaceful activists. But its not just limited to people protesting their action, the agribusinesses are also ruining the lives of indigenous populations. According to an interview with a Billy Kyte, campaign leader on this issue at Global Witness in an article by the Guardian article in 2017, "“Communities that take a stand against environmental destruction are now in the firing line of companies’ private security guards, state forces and contract killers,” he said. “For every land and environmental defender who is killed, many more are threatened with death, eviction, and destruction of their resources. These are not isolated incidents. They are symptomatic of a systematic assault on remote and indigenous communities by state and corporate actors.




<br><hr>

That statement stood out to me as well because it just didn't make sense. I thought "Is he delusional?" How is it possible to even think that or be obtuse enough to say it aloud. But that is probably how a lot of people in environmentally destructive and cruel industries believe. I have been on the fence to go vegetarian for a long time, and this film might just make me one for a lot of reasons. The fact that it takes more than 600 gallons of water just to produce a burger is bizarre, especially when there are so many people in the world that don't even have access to.water, yet a lot of us waste it just to have a gross meal. The meat industry also leads to deforestation and the destruction of whole ecosystems. It's connected to so many environmental hazards which makes it even more crucial that more people begin to adopt a plant-based diet.


<br><hr>

That part got me laugh, so was the scene  the girl praised how pigs are nice and all and minutes later she just joked around turning them into bacon. At the begining I was confused about whether or not the organizations didn't know or pretend not to know about the driving cause of environmental damages, as they were either speechless or quite evasive on the subject of matter. This is a great movie and yet another movie and I think I will start my transition into vegan starting now. I don't know how far I can go but I think it will be great knowing someone who are or also planning on being a vegan on the future, so we can share with and encourage each other.




<br><hr>

I agree, it was insane to hear the level of denial among the top executives of the meat industry. I don't think it's reasonable to give the executives the benefit of the doubt in just "not knowing" about the negative effects of the industry they lead. Large meat companies spend astronomical amounts of money on research, figuring out the best ways to appeal to their customers and dedicating billions of dollars to understanding all the effects and byproducts of their industry inside and out. This denial isn't a problem of negligence: these executives make the malicious decision to ignore the negative byproducts of the means by which they get rich. Knowing that the only way to combat this malicious negligence is to avoid their products motivates me to seriously consider changing my diet.




<br><hr>

I totally agree with you. I feel like they are just like the fossil fuel companies, who make money out of the environment. And it sounds so ridiculous that being the representatives of the companies that relate to livestock do not know about the impact of its production on our environment. And just like what you said in the comment, they actually do not care. What Will Potter in the film said has shocked me. I never thought that animal production could have such a huge role in people’s lives. People are paying so much attention to politics but forget about the real big threats to our lives. There are so many dark sides of this industry that we, the people who do not work there, do not know about it. And it is even more shocking that people are being killed of spreading the truth of this industry. When the man talked about people drinking milk, I came to realize that it is sad people have been taking away baby calf’s food away for our own goods. I do not know what to say… It’s just sad to me to even think about it.




<br><hr>

I am partially agreed with your opinion and feeling just really confused or pessimistic for the author to think about that. For example, it is just like saying one quarter-pound hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to produce.  Following this logic, what about us, as a human. As a consumer and the top of the food cycle, should we even exist? Or maybe we should decrease the population largely?
<br><br>
I just feel that I was restricted from every move I made. It is just like, even though I eat a bite of burger. The world will be destroyed 500 years later. I was just so confused and have nothing to do with the problem. Restricting or convincing people from doing things it not the best way to solve the problem. Maybe live on another planet in the future or use any other energy to replace the environmental crisis will be the solution.




<br><hr>
Just as you said that your quote summed up all the people who Kip interviewed I 100% agree! It is so very clear that they all know what’s really going on but they refuse to agree and open the eyes of their ignorance. At the end of the day, these people are defending themselves and their own selfish lifestyles and that’s the sad truth. They don’t really care about the planet and so therefore the best they can do is make money off of denying the biggest reasons behind the climate crisis and trying to convince others of the same.
<br><br>

What’s truly scary to me is that these are supposedly the people or higher-ups who the general public is supposed to trust to tell us the truth of what’s going on with the resources that WE survive on, but they don’t. Most people who are blind or deny the climate crisis are people who watch the higher-ups speak lies every day and believe it. How does someone go about fighting the government and informing the people of what we’re causing? Kip is succeeding at answering this question simply by this film he made. It made me rethink my own eating habits and convince me that while changing my diet isn’t easy, it will never be more important over the health of this planet and therefore all the species.





<br><hr>

Correct. I feel upset to those organization which do not admit any effect they made for this planet. After all, they just want to make more money. Eat less meat cannot solve the problem. We need to let more people know the effect what cow and livestock industry have so we can make more people change their eating habits. The government may also be able to formulate policies that make people have to reduce waste, such as the examples in the video. At the same time, we should reduce food waste. The United States makes the world the most wasteful country. If we reuse the wasted food, a lot of clean energy will be provided.

I found the statement very hypocritical to be saying they love animals and that is why they’re in the meat industry. One of the core reasons why I decided to go vegetarian over 4 years ago was because of how the meat industry is run and how terrible it is to animals, yet you have these people are simply supporting the meat industry because it gives them money. I mean we even had the young daughter explaining that she tries not to get emotionally close to the pigs because she knows eventually they will be killed. That situation sounded like a girl who loves animals, but is forced to put her care aside for the idea of money and profit back. All of this seems all too familiar, as you pointed out, this seems to be similar to the actions of all the organizations that Kip interviewed at the beginning of the film.

When I saw that scene I had the same reaction, I couldn’t believe with what I was hearing. It didn’t make sense to me how they could believe what they were saying if animal conditions showed otherwise. Someone who loved animals wouldn’t be raising them in such horrible conditions. What ran through my mind in that moment was, “Who are you trying to convince that you truly love animals? Me, yourself, or both?” It made me wonder if when they lie to us they are lying to themselves to make themselves feel better. Another part of the film that surprised me was that sustainable fishing is not really a thing. That it’s only called that to make ourselves feel better about the fish we are eating. For the longest time I gravitated towards sustainable caught fish because I thought I was doing something better for the environment. Even though I knew most of the things this film presented about the beef industry, it was eye opening to see other aspects I had overlooked or had not been educated on.

There are so many wrong things with the people interviewed during this documentary. As you said, how is it possible that none of the top organizations that swear to protect the environment are so oblivious of pollution by animal livestock? I was so upset to hear their responses and how they would made up ridiculous arguments to get out of the situation. It is clear that the animal industry is doing everything in their power to silence those who oppose them. Even Kip was scared about his life, yet he decided to continue pursuing the documentary. He emphasized that this is a bigger problem that himself and should be communicated around the world. One of the solutions that Kip and others agreed on was to change to a plant-based vegan diet. While Kip himself was scared of such change, as it would dramatically change the way he lived, he decided to go for it. Like everyone, he did his research and talked to a nutritionist and told him his concerns about taking dairy and meat products out of his life. This is what astonished me the most. The person told Kip that milk is not meant to be for humans which makes total sense. They are supposed to be for baby cows! So why does people drink it? Well, the dairy and other industries have deceived many people around the world to make them believe that milk is essential for human growth when in reality is not. Furthermore, the nutritionist tells kip that everyone can grow healthy with a simple vegan diet as plants provide all the vitamins and resources a human need for development. We should focus in new ways to feed ourselves instead of feeding our livestock. If we did that, then we would be able to produce food for everyone! especially those who suffer hunger. Moreover, this is not only about us reducing our meat-based diets but also to stop mistreating animals. The slaughter shown in the film really made me uncomfortable, not because of the blood, but because of the way animals were being killed. I just feel like animals are thought of objects which I believe is far worse than thinking of them as animals. Humans are animals, so imagine if a superior race dominates the earth instead of us and kills us the same way we kill animals. Would we like that? I don't think so. I believe in animal rights as I believe they feel--maybe not in the same way as we do, but still do. Lastly, I just want to say that people as ignorant as the ones in charge of such environmental groups, shouldn’t be in charge. They are hypocrites who preach something and do opposite of what they say. We can save the planet by changing to plant-based diet and this could be done in a matter of months! Within a year, almost the entire human population could disregard meat and reduce methane emissions significantly. There’s need to be a cultural change rather than a technological change.

I was also surprised at the lack of concern over animal agriculture among these top environmental organizations. I found it interesting that he began with a clip of an interview with the Deputy Executive Director of Sierra Club, Bruce Hamilton. He goes into such detail about all of the catastrophic impacts of climate change, yet when he was asked about livestock and animal agriculture his response was, "Uh, well what about it?" It really shines a light on how we often focus on a specific component of the issue, ignoring the larger picture. I think a part of the reason behind this is because it requires a critical look at the individual self. Accepting the reality behind animal agriculture and the tremendous impact it has on not only on the environment, but also on communities where most of these agricultural practices are carried out really pushes you to think about your own actions and how your diet contributes to this issue. It is not an easily digestible task.

The film Cowspiracy leaves me with a heavy heart. I believe it was a good approach for the filmmaker to take on a perspective as one who was trying to seek out all the answers and answer his confusions. While this is quite an eye-opener for me, I was extremely shook and terrified at these enormous numbers. And what’s driving that number is not only happening right now, but also would only help increase these digits. I had never thought agriculture would be such a big problem across the globe, and all the devastating effect it had brought to the environment and climate. And this is not only on the land. According to the film, quite a few areas of ocean had become bio-dead zones thanks to the toxic substances being released into water due farming. In addition to that, I never knew the massive scale of fishing, and the collateral effect it has on other species, and it shook me more that by 2048 we would have 0 fishes in the ocean. 
<br><br>

On the other hand, what triggers me more is the lack of acting against these issues, especially on animal husbandry. It is shocking yet devastating that almost not a single environmental organization would be willing to admit that cattle ranching is the No.1 causes for most of the environmental degradation and destruction in the world. Of course they would be well-aware of it, it’s just nobody wants to be the one that openly talk about it. I think the analogy about the binge drinking husband in the family one guy draw was fairly accurate when talking about these organizations’ attitudes. They want to maintain their prestige and financial support, and for that, ironically, they become the enemy of their own. On one side they were trying to prevent climate change, but they won’t even address, or even talk about the biggest issue on climate change. And that’s very heart-sinking for me.





<br><hr>
“Cowspiracy” was a very eye-opening film for me as well.  I found it truly shocking to see that Kip Anderson could not find the answers he was looking for.  The interviews showed me just how disconnected people are from this issue.  I was surprised to see that the organizations did not even bring up the meat industry as a factor in the climate crisis.  Considering that ranching releases much more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the transportation industry, I was truly at a loss for words when I saw how organizations choose to overlook the meat industry.  This film really impacted my way of thinking and has seriously led me to develop a need for slowly trying to make changes in my lifestyle.  As a person who eats meat, this film left me feeling guilty for my contribution to this cycle.  Not only is raising livestock bad for our planet, but the treatment of the animals is completely unfair and unjust.

I really enjoy reading your comment. The film is very effective at communicating its subject. Overpopulation is the primary problem for the world and scarcity is never going to be fulfilled. Most people eat meat every day and they have a responsibility to know the true cost to produce meat.  I feel angry and helpless after watching the whole movie. I am also a member of the environmental protection organization. What an irony is those facts I had never been told until I watched the movie like the director. However, the problems caused by animal agriculture are almost impossible to be solved. We live in a very large world and we can’t control everyone to let them stop eating meat. The owners of animal agriculture are very rich and have very strong political power. They can control the government and would not let this happen. 
<br><br>
I learned a lot. After watching it, it just makes me feel pessimistic. It changes my attitudes towards the government and environmental protection organization. Because of money and power, they choose to hide the secret for animal agriculture. But for human behavior, they also can’t do anything about it. In this situation, there is no right or wrong. We can only eat less meat, reduce the area of animal agriculture. Hope it can improve the situation




<br><hr>
I loved that you pointed out the quote "I love animals, which is why I'm in the meat industry." These two ranchers made me actually laugh during the film. I found it so contradicting and just out right crazy to make a statement like this. How can you love animals at all if you raise livestock for consumption. I think this point was made clear with the inclusion of the backyard duck slaughtering as it showed how one simply cannot love animals if they raise them as food. The slaughter clip showed just how brutal this business is. How can you say you love an animal just to chop its head off as soon as its big enough to eat. Furthermore, these are ducks and the slaughtering of ducks is simpler than the process often used with larger livestock. I have seem some incredibly cruel videos of cows being slaughtered. And when I say cruel I mean absolutely inhumane actions. 
<br><br>

I think the other part of this documentary that really stood out to me was the fact that people are afraid to stand up to these big companies, and rightfully so. It is a scary battle to go up against such powerful people. The world is dominated by money and these companies have all the money. Not only do companies use money as a threat, but people are even killed for standing behind a good cause. I thought it was very important to include this in the film, especially the example of the nun that was killed. Because of these factors, I think Kip is very brave and we need more people in this world to be more like kip.





<br><hr>


I agree with you, how is it that you love animals so much you go into an industry that abuses them and treats these animals in such an inhumane way? I remember watching a video a few weeks ago about how the Fairlife milk company was treating their cows. It was such a disgusting video to watch because it showed how these cows were dying and being treated. It even showed how a mother cow just gave birth and within a few hours of her calf being born, she was put into the milking machine. It also showed how some of these cows were getting stuck in the machines and then were being yanked out. Just because these cows are not being bred to eat, they are still producing massive amounts of methane that are being emitted into the atmosphere. It is crazy how a lot of these organizations mentioned in the video will not admit that animal agriculture is the number one problem for the most emitted greenhouse gases.



<br><hr>

I had the same reaction when I watched this film last year.  It was so upsetting to see how none of the people this high up in the industry would even acknowledge the issue at hand, which makes me feel like there is no hope when it comes to changing the meat industry.  I'm not necessarily surprised that they won't acknowledge the evil they are in charge of creating, but it is still disheartening.  This film is great to watch if going vegetarian or vegan is something you are even slightly considering because it will push you to change, I even believe it has the power to push people who maybe weren't even considering making the switch in the first place.  The only problem is that most people who do not want to change or don't want to know what's going on behind the scenes will not seek out or watch these kinds of videos because they just don't want to experience the dissonance.




<br><hr>
My reaction was exactly the same as yours in regard to that statement. If I was not giving my complete attention to the film, that statement captured all of my attention and made me look at her incredulously. I cannot wrap my head around the idea that workers in the meat industry may claim to love animals and yet aid in the slaughter of millions of animals. I was also largely taken aback by Kip's discovery of the cover-up of the meat industry. It is harrowing that the meat industry has big environmental organizations under their fingers. It goes to show that even organizations that claim to care about the environment and aim to spread awareness in the fight against climate change can fall under the control of big money. It was frustrating to see organizations steer conversations away from the meat industry's contribution to climate change when it is a major factor in worsening the environment's condition. This just highlights the importance of films such as "Cowspiracy" in spreading information about climate change since there are many forces out there that want the information to stay hidden. This can also be seen in a previous film we watched, "A Climate of Doubt," where many skewed data to make climate change seem like a myth.




<br><hr>
I have similar feelings as you did after watching the film Conspiracy, as the scenes of killing those vivid animals really hurt my heart. After my learning in Biology, I do understand the mechanisms of food chain and food web that animals eat other animals naturally, which made me think that humans eating other animals can also be seen as a natural activity. However, I believe sometimes, some populations of humans are just eating too much animals, beyond a level that our world and natural systems can sustain, and this poses a threat to the sustainability of our planet. This class really affects my eating behavior as in the past, I eat and pick food mindlessly, only caring about whether the food is delicious or not and all, but now, I believe I am becoming more responsible regarding food choice. I feel happy with the change of my food choices as I believe this is both beneficial for my health and the environment. 
<br><br>

Conspiracy also informs me about the attitudes of those seemingly generous and kind environmental organizations. Previously, I thought those organizations are really trying hard to make a positive difference to our environments, but now, I become more critical and have a cool head about these organizations. The film Conspiracy also made me realize a lot of other serious impacts raising livestocks have on our environment, including water use, land use, etc.
<br><br>

Even though I did not watch the film Wasted!, I once watched a report about the chef in that film on how he transforms food scraps into delicious dishes, which really inspires me and made me wish more chefs like him. Moreover, just like Ken mentioned, how supermarkets disposed food that have a "secondary" quality like those that have passed the "Best by" date is also of vital importance. We need to more efficiently dispose of our food so that less people will starve and our planet will be able to sustain and thrive.

This film was literally effective at communicating its subject. It reveals the incredible ecological impact of large livestock farms on the planet, which is also destructive. The director posted a lot of interviews about this subject with people having different positions from experts to farmers to illustrate that many people are not willing to blame or admit that animal agriculture is closely connected with ecological environment’s deterioration and other environmental problems such as water resources shortage, desertification and pollutions. He also used a large amount of graphs and virtual images to form strong contrasts between livestock’s and other necessary factor’s daily cost, for example, he estimated the number of acres of rainforest that had been cleared because of palm oil and livestock feed crops to demonstrate how animal agriculture has been affecting out living conditions.
<br><br>


From its content we know that many people who are related to dairy and cattle industry, even from environmental protection organization are hiding this fact on purpose, at least they do not want to consider animal agriculture as a cause of environmental problems, so I believe that casual viewers are the main audience of this film. Learning about the truth that the dairy we daily consume is at such a large cost of our air, water source, and trees, casual viewers like me would begin to consider this issue seriously and decide to listen to advices mentioned in this movie like reducing the amount of meat we are eating, and dairy and eggs.
<br><br>


To be honest, I was shocked when I first saw livestock causes 51 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions and it was not regarded as leading cause of rainforest destruction by “Amazon watch”. I began to wonder why they are hiding this fact that should not be ignored.
<br><br>


I saw many incredible numbers about livestock’s consumption and learned about the impact of these issues on our living environment so that I would eat less animal agricultural products. However, I feel pessimistic about this change because this movie has not been watched by the majority of people so my own action just has minor influence close to 0.
<br><br>



Definitely, I would like to recommend this movie to my friends so that more people are going to know this fact and everyone could make a difference to save our environment in the future.




<br><hr>

When I first watched the documentary “Cowspiracy”, I was also surprised that animal agriculture surpass fossil fuel and emits more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. And also, the greenhouse gas, methane, that is 23 times stronger than CO2 was released by livestock such as cattles. I found it to be very frustrating too, that none of those so called environmental organizations are willing to admit that the meat industry was actually contributing to such horrible consequences that is harming the planet, even with numbers and statistics shown in front of their eyes.
<br><br>
Although I’m not a vegetarian, and possibly never going to become a vegan, I do control my daily meat consumption and eat more veggies and fruits instead.





<br><hr>
I appreciate you to point out that not a single organization was willing to admit that the animal agriculture business has an incredibly damaging effect on our environment. Like you, I also feel surprising that people who have great power in the organizations claim they have no idea about this fact. But we, as meat consumers, have an inescapable responsibility for the consequences. Hence, as you said, considering to become a vegan is a nice choice to cut down climate crisis.
<br><br>
Cowspiracy is still admirable although there was false information in the documentary, where Kip claimed animal products account for about 50% of total greenhouse gas emissions, but it’s actually 15%. To answer Ken’s question, I believe Kip just aims to raise people’s awareness about severe environmental damage caused by livestock industry. At once, Kip completely changed his lifestyle into to a way that everyone can imbalance with the planet after watching An Inconvenient Truth. It reveals that these alarming documentaries do influence people to act on protecting our planet. However, when he questions ecologically crisis would still continue whether people adopt an environmental living style, I feel hopeless. What can we, ordinary people, can do more than that? In order to save our planet, industries that harm our environment, like fossil fuel companies, airline companies, and meat industry, are the ones who have to change.




<br><hr>

That comment of “I love animals that's why I am in the meat industry” also stood out to me. How could you love animals that you raise them to be slaughtered. And not only raise them to be slaughtered, but raise them in the worst conditions and treat them inhumanely. It also blew my mind that not a single organization would admit to how bad the mean industry was for our planet. It makes me question how much they are withholding from us. I also think this film was done very interestingly as it shows the responses of other people and helps lead us to show that they are unreliable (the people in the meat industry). I think it is so sad that people are unwilling to admit just how bad the meat industry is. If they were to admit how bad it was, I think that more people would follow suit in not eating meat and not supporting any of the mean industry.




<br><hr>
I don't necessarily disagree with the ranchers saying that they love animals. That definitely isn't the main reason why they are ranchers but it's not necessarily false. This statement wasn't the best to use because of the documentary that it is in. My family is big in the agriculture occupations in the central valley so this was harder for me to watch because it is not all bad. My family owns a ranch and it has been in my family for generations. My grandfather, great-grandfather, and dad all have worked and owned a ranch and we are much more humane, free-range, and earth-conscious than most so it hurts to see what everyone thinks about the livestock economy, even if the facts are 
<br><br>
Everything could be more environmentally conscious, yes, but it is going to take a little bit of time to make these changes. There have been thousands of years of farming and livestock and to expect change right away is not the way to go. Teach them what they can do.





<br><hr>


I believe that film as you said was "(at times overwhelming)" to honestly be more than overwhelming. I had never once considered being a vegetarian, let alone vegan. The meat industry does what many large companies and corporations do, and that is move the blame and focus of their injustices else where. The statement you started out with "I love animals, which is why I'm in the meat industry" was a great way to start out your comment. It encapsulates how these large industries that contribute so much to the climate crisis do not care about the impact they have whatsoever as long as they are benefiting. It is disgusting. I too found it ironic that the organizations involved were not saying much about the climate change in responses to they tough questions that they were pressed with. This leads me to believe that they do now want the general population to know how much their business, the meat industry, contributes to the worsening situation of out climate. It is sad that instead of finding better and more sustainable food sources that these organizations find ways to down play the pressing situation and make it so that people are blindly still helping to contribute to the climate crisis. Once again, I never thought I would think about going vegetarian let alone vegan, but when presented with facts things must change you cannot remain ignorant. I believe it will take time to transition to move to more sustainable food sources but it is something that is necessary to improving the current state of our planet.



<br><hr>
I totally agree with you! When I heard them say they're in the meat industry because they love animals I was like "huh??" I understand they're trying to give the animals a good life before being killed but if they really cared for them, they should rethink their actions. Not only does livestock account for the leading cause of environmental degradation but they also require large amounts of water usage due to their diets. Another part of the movie that was pretty shocking to me was all the different environmental movements and organizations that refused to meet with Kip Andersen. Those who eventually did meet with him didn't really want to speak on the subject at hand. 
<br><br>
While watching Ken's youtube video on the film, the thought of someone who basically "dumpster dives" for food was kind of nasty to me. The more I thought about it and tried to see it from a freegan's point of view, I understood why they willingly chose to do it. The US produces more food than it actually consumes, which leads to large amounts of food being discarded and wasted at a time. I personally don't think living a freegan lifestyle is for me but I will say that after the first couple of weeks in this class, I realized I started being more cautious of the food I get and/or throw away. I applaud anyone who chooses to become a freegan because I believe it takes a lot of courage and pride to do that.





<br><hr>

This is so horrible...Really hope someone can stand out and make some changes...




<br><hr>

I totally agree. This film has seriously discussed about the question of eating meat. Which surprises me is that many organizations don't admit that the industry they are in is putting a huge burden on our climate and living environment. They don't even admit that this problem exists. They are mainly driven by economic profits and don't consider the outcomes of their behaviors. I've seen many commercials about animal slaughtering in medias, and I think it's really important to contain this part of fact in the movie to make the audience recognize the seriousness of the problem. Many of us don't admit the problem exists until the fact is directly revealed in front of our eyes.
<br><br>
I feel this movie really helpful to meat-lovers and people who have limited knowledge that our food industry is making the situation worse.



<br><hr>

I agree with you on the irony that was shown in the movie. How could you say you love animals when you let them suffer by slaughtering them. It simply doesn’t make any sense and it does make me feel sick when the meat company tries to justify their actions with an absolutely unreasonable excuse. 
<br><br>
Animal agriculture accounts for 15 percent of anthropogenic climate change. To me, I rarely consider the emission produced in making and processing the meat. However, Meanwhile, As I realize this issue and get more and more exposed to the benefits of vegan diet, I think it might be a good idea for me and my parents, who have been used to and kinda sick of eating meat everyday, to shift our diet to a more vegan eating habit.




<br><hr>

Your reaction to the “I love animals, which is why I’m in the meat industry” part is exactly what I felt. I have friends that said something similar to this when they were in 4H and FFA in high school and it always confused me. I would think that that would make them want to stop the animal agriculture industry. Cowspiracy was the film that pushed me to become more serious about becoming vegan. Before, I had already stopped eating meat and most dairy products, thinking about going vegan but never actually committing. After learning what a large impact animal agriculture has on the climate, I completely stopped eating meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Knowing that Kip used incorrect information definitely hurt his credibility, but after learning that it was because he got it from a survey that was believed to be true, I see where the confusion came from. I thought about showing it to my parents, but I knew that they would hang onto how he over exaggerated his statistics and not believe what is true in the film. 
<br><br>

Wasted! was a really enjoyable film to watch. I found it interesting how they even made eating animal products more sustainable by using things that people would usually throw away, like the “trash fish,” cutting back on food waste. I did not realize that food waste had this large of an impact on the environment, but I’m glad that there are people out there doing something about it, whether they are chefs that use everything or countries that put laws in place to reduce food waste. I think it should be a topic that is discussed more seriously. We need to learn how to use as much food as we can, feed people first and try to reduce the number of people who are food insecure.




<br><hr>
I totally agree with you that no organization is willing to admit that livestock is such a huge environmental burden, how crazy it is. These people are supposed to be fighting in good faith for a better planet, and they're ignoring a huge problem, in part because it's going to hurt the amount of money they get. I think it's sad that people are so reluctant to change their habits, even though they're causing millions of people to suffer from climate change, not to mention billions of animals. We waste food, it is shameful, wrong all pain on the lives of the animals we can slaughter, boiled, and then throw it away, because one-third American food is wasted. I've been a vegetarian for nine months, and fortunately, it's become a lot easier because there are more and more vegan products in restaurants and stores, but I still hate being a vegan or the stigma behind being a vegetarian. Vegetarians are always made fun of and called rubbish when they are brave enough to do the right thing. When I first became a vegetarian, people around me would try to convince me that I wouldn't get enough nutrition and I wouldn't be able to function properly, but after learning more about it, I knew that this was completely incorrect. People are healthiest when they eat plant-based foods. You can get more nutrients and protein from plants. I've also seen the documentary what is health, which explains that milk has a purpose - to turn calves into big cows. They describe it as bovine growth hormone, and most people are lactose intolerant for a reason. It's easy to become a vegetarian, especially with all the different plant-based "meat" options available. As Thoreau said in "Walden," look at the mighty bull that can pull a plow for hours on end, eating nothing but plants. I think more people must be aware of the impact of eating meat on the planet and hopefully that will prompt people to take action.





<br><hr>


LOL, when I hear that statement my jaw was down and mouth so wide open and doubting myself for not hearing properly. However, as you have said, this is tells the ignorance of people from the industries whom we thought are most relevant to the cause of cliamte crisis. It also makes me worry about their kids whose parents have no idea that they made major contribution to climate crisis night end up repeating the mistakes made by them. It is similar to climate crisis deniers. We should ask what make this happen? It is education or culture or something else that ends up someone saying statement so absurd and ignorant.



<br><hr>

I agree with what you say. Although Cowspiracy was an informative film but it did have some incorrect information. Fossil fuel usage is the leading cause of pollution and we need change that by switching to renewable energy sources such solar power. Agriculture does have a large impact on pollution as well. Although it does not cause 51% of pollution as stated in the film, it still causes 15% of it which is a large portion still. What we can do to combat that is by changing our lifestyles and the way we eat. Consuming less meat or even switching to become vegans or vegetarians will have an impact on the agriculture business. Also instead of consuming dairy products, we can switch to plant alternatives. Agriculture is having a detrimental affect on our forest as well. Deforestation has occurred and is still occurring in order to have more room to raise more cattle. The Amazon is the lungs of the Earth and is responsible for consuming a large portion of the Earth's CO2. We need to preserve it in order to have clean air and oxygen for us to live.




<br><hr>

I agree that it was surprising that organizations weren't identifying the animal agriculture as a big greenhouse gas emitter.  When organizations didn't want to address how big livestock contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, it really put into perspective how organizations want to protect themselves in a way and continue to get money from people for not putting all the facts out. It made me upset that organizations weren't willing to talk to Kip because of the questions they knew he would have. Also in the interview he had with the California Department of Water Resources, when he brought up animal agriculture and its water footprint, Kamyar Guivetchi said that it was not his area yet still said that he believed that the animal husbandry has a water footprint that is greater than any other activities but because of the way government was set up, they wouldn't encourage people to eat less meat. This shows that while people may be informed about the way things are they can't change it due to how things are run.




<br><hr>
I also thought that the sentence you quoted was quite paradoxical, but I don’t think it has to do with the environmental organizations not acknowledging the burden that the meat industry has on the environment. I think that the environmental leaders just fear for their lives. The meat industry has so much power politically that it would be difficult to do anything in the US, especially with an anti-meat slogan. It would give their rivals ammunition to also discount every other stance they make because meat is such a large part of the American diet that dissing meat becomes something offensive. In other countries like Brazil though, the meat industry has enough power to be its own cartel. They can order and get away with hits on environmentalists so practicing there would pretty much be suicide.





<br><hr>

There is a part of your opinion that I totally agree with. No organization will admit that animal husbandry imposes a great burden on our environment.But I think the biggest reason is not the farmers but the needs of the people.I don't think we have to be vegetarians to really contribute to the environment. We can eat meat, but we can't waste it.We kill hundreds of cattle and sheep every year, but a lot of them are wasted. If we can save the meat, I believe the effect will be remarkable.We can even save the environment by taking the initiative to reduce meat consumption.




<br><hr>


After watching the film and reading your comment, I totally agree with you. That statement is ridiculous if you ask me. How can you say you love animals, but you are willing to murder them and put them under unlivable conditions? Every organization just couldn't accept the fact that it does such bad to our planet. Many of these organizations deny that climate change is happening because that'll reduce their profit.I also agree with you on how powerful the slaughter being shown can be. It is hard to imagine that these animals go through severe pain and torture just to be killed at the end. It is saddening to see this and how careless some people can be.

“Cowspiracy '' seemed to be largely effective at communicating its subject through the use of statistics as evidence of the damages caused by livestock and meat consumption. By mentioning facts such as that a one quarter pound hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to produce, it will likely make consumers, like myself, to think again before purchasing one. The documentary did an incredible job of highlighting the negative effects that consuming beef has on our environment, one being that it leads to deforestation and hence the reduction of biodiversity just to raise cattle and meet our demand for beef. In addition to this, I find it very interesting that, just like textile industries, cattle industries show almost little to no remorse to the incredible toll they’ve had on the planet and continue to do whatever they can (even if it includes silencing activists) to make a profit and keep the public’s attention away from the climate crisis.

The film made me feel like I haven’t done enough as an individual to help reduce and avoid emissions. It made me reconsider my eating habits, for it largely revolves around the consumption of red meat. For most of my life I’ve been oblivious to the point where I failed to recognize that I am contributing to the emission of greenhouse gasses and mass consumption of water just by simply eating beef. Once again, I feel more pessimistic than optimistic because it seems like many people are still not open to changing their menus and eating options, even if it means allowing our planet to stay afloat for a century or few more.

 I agree with you.  This film had a similar impact upon me.  Even living as a pescatarian for over ten years now, I continue to watch things like this and worry about my eating habits and the affect that I personally make.  This film in particular opened my eyes to the impacts of dairy.  I have been trying for a while now to stop consuming dairy products, but it is very difficult.  I too, feel pessimistic about the potential for change from the broad public, however I do have hope.  I hope that this film can be spread to many more people, who will take it into consideration and find it in their hearts to at least limit their beef and dairy consumption.

I found it more angering than interesting that the cattle industry shows no remorse as for their impacts on the environment.  It's incredibly frustrating to me that these people build this kind of industry, raise their children to do just the same, and continue in this way with seemingly no awareness.  From deforestation to methane output, the impacts of the agricultural industry are endlessly dangerous for our planet.   We need to see more change and we need to see it soon.

I completely agree with you, this film was incredibly effective at communicating its subject through the use of all the digital graphics and visuals exemplifying how much of an impact cow grazing has on the environment. What amazed me the most was how the film compared the livestock feces to huge states and rainforest destruction to football fields. This was shocking because I was not informed about the extreme this issue was. Also, the interviews with the professional environmental organizations who address these types of issues allows us to realize that they are afraid of confronting the real issue causing global warming which make us think further into this topic. I understand where you are coming from when you say that you ended up reconsidering your eating habit because this film is definitely targeting American meat-eaters to look upon their personal lifestyle. I found myself having an intellectual response as I realized that eating meat may never be resolved and accept the fact that global warming will continue. If eating meat is the primary cause, we are in danger because changing people's behavioral habits can be exceedingly difficult. People can barely conserve electricity and water even though it can be simple actions like turning off the water when brushing your teeth. Also, I believe that not eating meat will cause harm to many companies such as fast food industries because people are selfish and care about money and financial profit instead of saving the environment. One fact that was crazy to hear was that activists are getting killed for speaking amongst these certain topics which is a complete saddening shock to me. After watching this film, I feel tremendously pessimistic because I believe it would be impossible to make individuals go vegan or try to change their eating habits. Many other individuals should watch this eye-opening and educational documentary because I think they would rethink their actions and motivate them to take action slowly but surely.

This film has largely reinforced my decision to cut beef out of my diet and lower my overall meat intake. It is incredibly unsustainable and wasteful for there to be ten livestock animals for every person, and even deciding to not eat one burger would save 660 gallons of water. There needs to be a greater awareness in society of how damaging the meat industry’s impact on the environment is. The government is obviously in the pockets of large meat corporations, seeing as their recommendations for people to reduce their carbon footprint don’t include switching to a plant-based diet and they’re unwilling to be transparent about the issue. The most shocking things for me was the extent to which animal agriculture impacts the earth; it consumes ⅓ of all freshwater, occupies 45% of land, is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon rainforest destruction, and is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, and habitat destruction. And yet, the world’s largest environmental groups don’t even consider it as an important aspect to focus on. I’m also feeling pessimistic about tackling the climate change issue because the meat industry has such a strong grasp on our society. One of the biggest issues with targeting animal agriculture is changing the way people think about meat. Younger generations are more readily adopting vegetarian and vegan lifestyles, but older generations have traditionally been far less receptive of having to give up their “fundamental right” to eat what they want to eat. Because the meat industry has so much power and influence over society and government, encouraging people to consume less meat is going to be a difficult task.

I also watched “Cowspiracy” and I agree with you. I found the film to be particularly effective in part because of its statistical evidence. When it comes to problems like the climate crisis, I think it’s really important to consider everything quantitatively instead of being taken in by false advertising put out by corporations that prioritize their own interests. I also really kept in mind Ken’s statement when watching this film: Some of the most effective changes that can be made to address the climate crisis involve changing our cultural attitudes towards food. 
<br><br>
It’s hard for me to wrap my head around how unapologetic and remorseless these corporations are. Just like the fast fashion companies and the fossil fuel corporations, the cattle industry seems to care for little beyond financial gain, refusing to acknowledge the large negative impact they have on the environment. Just like what we see earlier in the course with the fossil fuel corporations, they will even do what they can to silence activists, cover up the truth with false propaganda, and use smokescreen tactics to keep the public unaware just so they can continue making a profit. 
<br><br>


Finally, this documentary is one that definitely made me think about my own eating habits and I’m optimistic when I think about the positive changes that I can make as an individual. However, I also feel pessimistic because I’m unsure if America will ever be a culture of widespread plant-based diets (or at least I don’t think it will happen fast enough to make a difference for the climate). After all, many people believe that hamburgers and steaks on the BBQ are part of the quintessential American lifestyle and are quite proud of the fact. Deviating from that could be seen as un-American by many which just makes absolutely no sense at all to me. Instead, the heart of American culture should be the American dream and instead of focusing on personal wealth and success we should be focusing on the fact that when Americans come together, we’ve been able to make large global differences and right now, arguably, the most pressing issue we’re facing is the climate crisis.

I agree that the film did a great job telling the audience what mistakes the cattle industry has been and is still making. It made me feel a bit guilty too, thinking that how much resources I have wasted, how much damage I have indirectly made to the environment just simply by buying a meal with meat. However. I doubt the effectiveness of the message conveyed through this film because as early as in middle school, our school teacher has shown us documentaries and movies regarding the cattle industry and the negative sides of consuming a meat-diet. However, little influence do they make. My friends and family are still considering meat as a crucial nutrient in their diet, as the issues of deforestation and livestock ethics seem to be too “far away” from them. I personally think that the only effective way to persuade people to switch to a vegetable-based diet is to promote the vegan culture, and make it— although it might sound something similar as the abominable automobile culture Ken discussed before in lectures— popular and trendy. 

<br><br>

Me myself is not a vegetarian, but I have already been taking a step into changing my own diet gradually. I have been cutting the amount of meat I consume every week, little by little, and tracking the changes I’ve been making for the past few months. I realized that I have walked much more frequently to the salad bar instead of taking every beef or pork dish for dinner. Of course, the cultural change is always the hardest, but merely showing how cruelly and how devastatingly the cattle industry is operating is not working in my opinion, clips presenting the killings and slaughtering, data comparing the industry to anything we are familiar with to give us a clearer picture of how it really is will be forgotten eventually. To me, it is not the cattle industry that needs to be criticized, but the vegan culture needs to be promoted.

This movie as mentioned by Ken is not quite as accurate as possibly stated. While I do agree with this comment, I don’t necessarily think the statistics given are 100% fact and known truth among the scientific community. While I 100% know the effects of methane and production of meat on the environment, I do believe this film is made in a very biased and slightly false way. These statistics and claims made about this industry being the biggest issue I believe is slightly false, and somewhat and act for us to be scared and change. These forms of persuasion are very effective and even make myself want to consume less meat overall. I found this film overall interesting and somewhat informative, but enticing in the fact that it encourages change for the better of the climate overall.



<br><hr>
I have to agree with you, I sat after viewing this film and was left more pessimistic than optimistic. That seems to be the theme of this class, and honestly I mean I get it. How could it not be, our climate is in serious danger. Back to the film though, I thought it was alright and decently informative. It’s weird to think that cows will be the leading factor to our demise.. how dumb.  
<br><br>

I agree the film made me question my consumption habits.. the truth of the matter is that many won’t though so really how much does this do? How much can we even do? I just find myself asking this too often. I think the film was effective and influential overall despite this. The beef industry is absolutely horrific and as we know now- responsible for numerous horrific crimes against our environment.
<br><br>

Here is one thing I cannot and will not get on board with... that freegan stuff. That, is simply a health hazard. No. I’m sorry Ken but no can do man.

I agree that "Cowspiracy" was very effective in its use of statistics, I believe that even though Kip got some of the stats wrong in a major way, it was very effective in the same way Wallace-Wells' article grabbed the reader's attention. It was quite shocking to see the absolute disregard that the industry felt for all the harm they had caused; it put an evil face on an industry that largely consisted of small farmers and good, hard-working people for years.

<br><br>

I used to work at a grocery store in Los Angeles. The CA laws killed me every time we had to throw out food. If it was expired, it was thrown away, regardless of if the product doesn't really spoil or not. if the product was compromised by a small hole in the packaging, it was thrown out. The best example was one given by Ken; if one egg was cracked, the dozen were tossed. Food waste hurts, and if it doesn't hurt you when you throw out leftovers you just forgot to eat, bread you forgot you had, etc, than you don't understand the real impact that food waste has on our climate.



<br><hr>
I had a similarly pessimistic view after watching the documentary. Switching to a more plant-based diet is difficult enough for me as someone who is fairly well-educated on the state of the climate. I can only imagine how difficult it may be for the other 97% of Americans that still have yet to convert to a vegetarian/vegan diet. Towards the conclusion of the film, people were saying it was as easy as not eating meat and all our problems could go away. However, I feel like such a statement is so idealistic, and therefore, not reasonable to accomplish in the near future. We can't pretend as if people will suddenly act in the interest of the environment after eating meat for their entire lives. I genuinely believe that as long as their is a single living cow on this earth, it will eventually be consumed by some person. It is even more unsettling knowing how much political influence these people have on our government, making changes in policy difficult.



<br><hr>
I agree with you. It made me feel more pessimistic than optimistic because I think people would be less open to changing their eating habits than other habits like using less water and plastic. It is especially worse since the meat and dairy industry are the most destructive to our environment. I found it extremely shocking that the meat and dairy industries produce more greenhouse gases than all cars, trucks, trains, boats, and planes combined. Last week, our class was just talking about how detrimental one flight from LA to Paris is to our environment and now we are learning that the meat and dairy we consume does not come close to one flight on a plane. It is difficult to imagine that one burger wastes 660 gallons of water. I think that if people were more aware of the damage the meat and dairy industry is causing they would reconsider their eating habits. However, even the organizations that claim to want to save the environment turn a blind eye to the fact that raising and eating cattle is the number one cause of greenhouse gas emissions. It seems hopeless when even the world’s largest ocean conservation group is recommending people to eat fish rather than advising them to stop eating fish to prevent overfishing and bi-kill.

<br><hr>
This film also made me really reconsider my red meat consumption. I'm someone who really enjoys a burger, probably safe to say they're one of my favorite foods. But is enjoying a meat burger really worth all the waste that comes from them? Beyond burgers taste almost identical, but also aren't the most sustainable. But then there's also the argument that we're already too late to reverse climate change so what's the point, right? This factor of climate change is probably one of the most controversial since almost EVERYONE has eaten meat since the beginning of time. I also think people, for some reason, get offended when people tell them how their diets are bad for the Earth.
<br><hr>
Watching Cowspiracy was an eye-opener. I totally agree with you that Cowspiracy did an effective job of communicating the facts and the numbers of water and greenhouse emissions that comes from producing meat. Before watching Cowspiracy I knew how bad the beef industry was to our planet, and I knew that they were the leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions, but while watching the documentary and seeing all these environmental groups not mentioning or possible not even knowing that the beef industry was the leading cause affecting the climate crisis and most of the environmental harm to oceans and rainforests. To me, it is crazy to think that people on this planet have such a high demand for beef and dairy products and that is harming our planet. Then on top of that, what is mentioned in the video that we use so much land to feed livestock while we have people and children who are going hungry and can not eat. We need to start turning to plant-based diets because the way the world population is going is that we will have more people on this planet and there is no way or no room on the planet to feed 9 billion people on the same meat-based diet we have now. I also agree with you that this film makes you rethink how you and what you eat, and that we as people on this planet need to look elsewhere to get our protein because this obsession with meat is wrong. But I still feel optimistic that at least in the United States we can change as a society for the better.
<br><hr>
I agree and think that "Conspiracy" did a great job getting its message through to the viewers, with the use of facts and statistics. I thought that the visuals were very compelling because, at least for me, it is easy to get lost when talking about such big numbers. Kip I think also did an outstanding job relating to the viewer, discussing how he grew up as an average america, and how he too becomes frustrated or discouraged or at times even confused by the complexity and seeming counter-intuitiveness of the subject. I was honestly pretty shocked by the magnitude of the dangerous aspect of speaking out against the mega agriculture industries. I of course know and assume that many huge companies are mostly concerned with their profits and have bent rules in the past, but I had no idea the scope of the controversy that a documentary like this would cause. It was really discouraging to learn that the main statistics of what percent of carbon emissions are from agriculture and livestock annually. Additionally it gave me pause the the documentary suggested that environmental groups are being paid off by the livestock industry, but there was no evidence nor proof. From my understanding of interest groups it is understandable that each interest group may have one or a few specific focuses. Therefore I am not sure if I agree with Kip when he went after these groups and called them out. While they are not taking on the responsibility of pursuing the specific issue of the meat industry, their work is important and implying that they are being paid off feels to me like hurting the environmental movement as a whole. This of course is not to say that they all make the most environmentally sound decisions all of the time, like what the representative at Oceana said about fishing. I think that Oceana does try to be environmentally conscious but still has a lot of work to do.

<br><hr>
Yes! The fact that beef has such a huge impact on the environment is what really amazed me. 660 gallons of water is a really great way for them to give us a quantifiable reason why beef is a big environmental impact. The beef industry is a scary thing, it is backed by so much power and I think cowspiracy really showed the evil behind the industry

Upon watching the film “Wasted”, I became more educated on how food is wasted. Hearing the figure of ⅓ is different from seeing the many clips of dumpsters, landfills, and other visual demonstrations of food that is regarded as trash and thus thrown away, especially when that amount of food could have been used to feed the hungry. And even though I already assumed food waste came from surplus production, expiration dates, and the way food looks, I did not consider how it also results from leftovers in the production process of what is deemed edible or not in society. For instance, they show how we only consume 40% of a cauliflower despite the leaves being edible or common types of fish despite nets catching other edible seafood. Because of this, I really appreciate how chefs incorporated these types of foods in their dishes, as well as how they emphasized that all food should be appreciated rather than wasted overall, so long as it is edible.
<br><br>
Additionally, I think it is clever that the filmmakers constructed a pyramid to show the best options for food waste, then structured the film into sections to show how each of the ways to solve it have been implemented. Whenever I think of food waste solutions, I only associate it with composting, so it was interesting to see that it is one of the less beneficial options to deal with waste. Also, this film exposed me to how electricity could be generated through food waste. If the yogurt company was able to do this while saving both money and food, I don’t see why other companies under similar conditions would not want to do this. Moreover, although the landfill would obviously be the most environmentally troublesome option, I had the same reaction as the random interviewees who learned that it can take a simple food decades to decompose in the landfill. I think that hearing this, and watching the film in general, will make me more conscious of how I should only buy what I will definitely eat to reduce my environmental impact.

“Cowspiracy” is very interesting in that it asks many tough questions about a subject that seemingly no one wants to talk about. It most certainly caused me to look at my own habits and how they are affecting the Earth as it is, but I also could not help but question certain aspects of it as I watched the documentary. While I certainly believe the information presented to be overall true, it seems strange to me that the cattle industry could be one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters and yet, as presented in the documentary, absolutely no one is talking about it. It seems a little too far fetched to be believable because climate change in and of itself is a controversial topic with many powerful interests attempting to claim it as a hoax, so why is it that the cattle industry interests have the power to silence everyone on the subject? Perhaps that may be the point of the documentary, as it is a “cowspiracy,” but I am not quite sure myself.

From my personal experience with growing up with climate change deniers, the claim that cattle methane emissions make up most of the greenhouse effect has just become a rebuttal for facts and evidence being presented to them about the matter. Sure, it may be true to an extent, but they do not know the intricacies behind the many of other factors that are driving this anthropogenic crisis. Thus, they do not have the knowledge to speak on the matter, which could be concluded from just hearing someone say "I don't believe in climate change".
<br><br>


To touch on the part where nobody is talking about the issue: many climate activists tend to factor these emissions into the broader beef/meat industry, which furthers the claim that this singular industry is largely responsible for the warming we are experiencing on this planet. This juxtaposition may seem confusing for some, but it will not matter if people start to take away support to meat industries. If a large amount of people could coalesce and lean away from meat-based diets, then these corporations will not only have less incentive to process their product, but also tend after cattle that directly emit methane into the atmosphere.

I actually remember the documentary "Cowspiracy'' quite well - I first watched it in my final year of high school, and it prompted me to go on a vegetarian diet for almost 3 months. Growing up in a city where all forms of meat come ready to markets, I never got to really experience the slaughtering process, and that's why witnessing the brutal murder of an animal was such a gut-wrenching image. Eventually, my vegetarian diet had to end due to cultural and health-related reasons, as I wasn't adapting too well to the lack of proteins coming from animal meat; having thought about it, however, maybe a more perfect diet would have led me to a better state where I could happily stay away from meat products. Honestly, eating an excessive amount of red meat is just not that healthy; on the other hand, there are many ways to cook tasty, nutritious meals that don't involve meat :)
<br><br>

I agree with my fellow classmates that the Sierra Club's tone-deaf response to the severity of animal agriculture is troubling to hear. I understand that everyone probably looks at the problem from a different perspective, but something like this should never be dismissed, especially coming from a supposedly "green" institution. I do think that veganism/vegetarianism has picked up more popularity in recent years, but this documentary was nevertheless a frustrating watch and a thought-provoking experience.

Hi! In the 6th grade, my best friend tried to convince our friend group to be vegetarian with her by showing us youtube videos of meat packing industries and the treatment of the animals in those facilities. Although horrific and traumatizing, none of us were convinced to completely cut meat out of our diets. In my family, all of our meat is hunted or fished by my stepdad, so everything is humane and more ethical. I didn't think about going vegetarian until 8th grade when I became pescatarian for 11 months. I felt a lot better because I didn't eat red meat any more. I ended that and started eating more meat because I was a two-sport varsity athlete in high school. Starting my senior year, I went back to being pescatarian again and I felt so good. Because of the impact the meat industry has on the environment and even your health, I feel disgusted when I, myself, eat meat. I will not shame or force anyone into being vegetarian, but I believe that educating people on the environmental aspects that the meat industry affects is important. 
<br><br>
The meat industry causes deforestation, excess water consumption, pollution, more greenhouse gases than transportation does, rainforest extinction, species extinction, habitat loss, topsoil erosion, and ocean dead zones. It is baffling to me that something that isn't even necessary in our daily diets can be so catastrophic to the earth and the population entertains it as much as we do.

I found the film “Wasted” very influential and surprising. I knew that composting was a good way to form healthy soil, but I was unaware that sending food to the landfill was releasing methane. This isn’t something that is commonly taught within schools or general public knowledge. It was very eye-opening to see the impact I was having by throwing away my food in the trash bins. Now when I go to throw excess food items away, I’m going to be aware of what it is doing to the planet. When the film stated that it takes 25 years for a head of lettuce to decompose, I was in disbelief. It makes me thankful that the dining commons have their own food waste system and gets composted. I can see why this is also a big cultural issue by being exposed to other countries’ customs. America loves to have a surplus of all items, including food. While other countries are charging people a bill depending on how much their food waste weighs. It is amazing how different we are from these other countries that are being extremely sustainable and trying to make a difference. There are small places around America that are doing what they can to make a difference, such as the school in New Orleans and the seafood restaurant. As the number of sustainable organizations increases, there will have a more influential impact on others. 
<br><br>

I wish I was exposed to this information a lot sooner. Now, I am rethinking my diet and how my usual food scraps can be repurposed. Personally, I cannot convert this into energy, but I can watch the amount of food I order or make for myself. Not only would this help my carbon footprint, but also help my well-being. I actually enjoyed this film a lot more than I was going to. It was amazing to see the eye-appealing plates that were created from food waste. I hope more of these restaurants pop up and become successful.

I found the film influential too. It’s so true that America loves to make a huge surplus of everything. Weeks ago, it’s the fast fashion leading to the surplus of clothing. And in this movie it’s the surplus of food we threw away. I still remembered how wasteful people are in my high school. People always get more than they can eat and they have already knew they are not going to finish it. Every time then when I go to turn my plate in, I can always see a whole bucket of food dumped by the students. This occurred everyday, as people simply view it’s normal without knowing what they are actually doing. People should be educated more in order to prevent further damage.

I really enjoyed watching Cowspiracy and going on this "search for truth" type journey with lead Kip Anderson. His use of visuals for once is very captivating and informative. One of the moments that stood out the most to me was when he interviewed officials at the State water department and asked them about the amount of water that is used to produce beef. Their reactions and lack of speaking made me actually laugh aloud because it was so ridiculous. The stats were similarly almost absurdly funny. One hamburger completely erased all the work Kip was putting into limiting his carbon footprint and conserving water, and the whole time he had NO idea! Granted, this is exactly how those profiting off of the meat industry want it to be, but it makes me wonder if people who pat themselves on the back for riding their bikes or not using a plastic straw know about this issue and if not, how they would grapple with it. 
<br><br>

I have had the conversation about restricting meat in my diet and the particular dangers of eating red meat with my parents on several occassions. They always revert back to their argument that meat has a certain protein or nutrient that cannot be substituted or supplemented, thus humans "need to eat meat." I don't know where they got this notion or if it true but it is an argument I hear from a lot of different people and am wondering where this comes from. Perhaps Ken could enlighten me.

I completely agree with this comment and share a lot of the same thoughts. Being Filipino, Korean, and Caucasian I have definitely had my fair share of meat and then some. It really is part of culture (eating chicken adobo with my grandma or Korean BBQ for really any occasion). I know that no amount of facts and convincing would change my parents stance and actions regarding meat consumption--and even more so my grandparents--it’s just part of life they would say. One of my cousins actually made the decision to go vegan about four years ago for health reasons as she wanted to stay very slim (and because all her friends were doing it) and to this day she still gets backlash from our family. Our grandma still offers her meat dishes and no one considers her dietary needs when choosing a restaurant to go out to. For these reasons (family and judgement) and because I was a very high-level athlete for a long time I never made the switch. I was worried that changing my diet would change my performance and with college recruitments and other high pressure events a diet change was not on my mind. However, now I have been consciously eating less meat and perhaps could make the change to vegetarian soon. Entering this class I considered myself environmentally conscious because I would take actions like not using plastic straws or only drinking from my water bottle. While small acts of conservation such as those are helpful--they are minuscule in comparison to what a plant-based vegan diet can do for this planet. "Cowspiracy" taught me that politicians with lots of power will not speak the truth due to the organizations that fund them. The people we are supposed to trust the most to give direction for our lives are actually the ones being manipulated to present a viewpoint far from the truth. I was shocked by the amount of turbulence this film caused and the potential repercussions one could face for just trying to seek out the truth. Ken’s introductory video did make me take a step back knowing that this film was built on false facts (animal emissions being only 15% rather than over 50% as stated in the film). Despite this, the last scenes of the movie were inspirational and really resonated with me. “Do whatever you can to the best of your ability and you will die one of the happiest individuals”. This statement was so powerful because it puts into perspective that not everyone can be making the same changes in their diets / lives to help the environment. For example, you would not ask populations in third world countries that live in poverty wondering where their next meal will come from to refuse any food that contains animal products. However, if you are the Kardashians--you would expect that with their financial status they could all be making the change to fully vegan lifestyles and help others do the same. As for anyone who falls in between (such as me) I think you can do the best you can and make sure you really ask yourself if you “Want that egg or steak or chicken nugget” because what you do really does make an impact for this planet. My biggest takeaway from this documentary is that change is pertinent now more than ever and the longer we wait, the shorter time future generations will have a livable future.

When watching "Wasted! The Story of Food Waste!", I was surprised at the amount of food we waste. The amount of food we waste is unacceptable especially when there are so many people who are starving in the world. This film gives an insight on how much of the food we buy is wasted by having them go to landfills after we no longer want to consume them.  The film gives alternatives to what we can do with food compost. There was a part of the film that really gave me hope for the future. It is the part where the school is shown in which the students take their compost from food and use it to grow new food. This part gave me hope because I feel that it is important to teach students at an early age not to be wasteful of their food. This was not something that was taught to me when I was younger. I remember when I was in elementary school I was a very picky eater and would not finish everything that the school served to us and just let it go to waste. If I would have known at an early age that this was harming the planet, then I probably would have taken food from home or only have taken what I knew I was going to eat. The school mentioned in the film is teaching their students not to be harmful to the planet in terms of our food consumption. I also really liked how the students actually enjoyed making their own food and would choose carrots rather than a bag of potato chips. This film also gives insight to how picky we are with our food. I liked how the film gave the example of the father who really enjoyed the food until he knew he was eating tongue. This shows how picky we are when it comes to what we eat. It also shows how what we deem as disgusting and delicious is not really based on taste. I also liked how it was drawing more attention to foods that are not very popular, but are really good like fish. The film shows how we love salmon and shrimp a lot, but there are a lot of other fish that taste just as good, we just will not give those other fish a chance because we know what we like to eat and we want to just stick to that. This film teaches its audience that there is so much more we can be doing with our waste rather than sending it to the landfill.

I share your feelings of being being totally shocked at how much food we waste after watching "Wasted! The Story of Food Waste!". What I immediately thought about is how my family's eating habits falls under the wastefulness shown in this film. We throw away tons of food that doesn't look, smell, or feel perfect and I never questioned if this was right. The amount of food waste this country is responsible for can be used to feed starving people within the U.S. and other impoverished countries. But it's frustrating knowing that this will never happen because the largest food producing companies are afraid of lawsuits or losing potential revenue-which was explained to have never happened before. What I also couldn't help but question is why the U.S. appears to be doing the least amount of work trying to end food waste. Italy, France, and South Korea are just as developed as this country and we are just as capable but on major difference is the willingness of ordinary people. American concern about wasting food  is probably much less than the rest of the world. Why? Because the public is not being informed. Most people don't question where their waste goes because why would you want to know anyway? Out of sight out of mind right. Until American citizens are exposed to the facts, then change can be made. The Green school in New Orleans is a perfect example the rest of the United States should be following. Change begins with students which affects families which affect communities and so on.

I love this film. Before watching this film, I always treated climate change as an urgent, dark, serious problem, that protecting our earth is a war and everybody needs to give up something to win (in some perspective, it is). However, this film makes me see the bright side of dealing with environmental issues. 
<br><br>

People in the film are inventing and generating more methods to reduce waste and also produce good products. This is so inspiring that the climate crisis not only gets talented people together to fight for the same goals but also boosts their creativity. For example, the chef who tries to make new delicious food with parts of vegetables that we usually throw away. Those foods that he made look even better than our usual dishes in the restaurants. Furthermore, the beer maker who make beers out of the bread edges. This creation does not only make a brand new product that is tasty but also solves a series of problems, like food waste.
<br><br>
 I really hope that their products will be accepted by more people rather than keep them small numerous. Maybe this could be achieved by advertising? since fast fashion obviously changes people's consumption concepts and living styles (though in a really bad way). I hope that this kind of positive things could get promoted and change people.  
<br><br>

I think in the future there will be more people who find either a brand new way to protect our earth or personal way to reduce their own carbon footprints in a creative way that makes our mother earth a better place.
 
<br><br>


I really love the course materials for this week, week6. It is encouraging and inspiring to watch. I hope, someday, I can also be a part of the people who keeps creating a better future for us.

The film “Cowspiracy” hit home on multiple emotional fronts multiple times throughout the entire project. Even though Kip Anderson did include some false information and may have evoked an alarmist type feeling, the film was a moving one. I think he was easy to fall in love with. He was so determined and eager from the very beginning to explore this issue and visited plenty of organizations such as Greenpeace, Sierra Club, Surfrider Foundation, Oceana, Rain Forest Action Network etc. He indirectly and directly called out such organizations for not wanting to talk about the issue of meat, animals, sustainability, climate change, etc. It was rather easy to see that all these companies were either trying to hide something or they just wanted to keep their “pristine” reputation. Like I mentioned earlier, Kip did present false information which can be rather damaging to his reputation and the film as a whole. Although we see the film still makes a great impact as all these companies are being put into the light more and more each day. I just want to finish off my comment by saying that every week these films just unravel how corrupt and unjust people can be, and how much profit and materialistic items can drive an individual.

I agree with what you say the film really did open up my eyes on how the consumption of meat and dairy products are costly to our environment. Although it wasn't the 51% as stated before, it is still an impact on our environment  that could be avoided by switching to a more plant based diet. It also amazed me how the organizations didn't talk about the agriculture business. Almost all of them wanted to avoid the topic altogether. It is sated that large amounts of activist were murdered for them being outspoken on the harm of agriculture but still, it is all our planet. If organizations were to really want people to help save the environment in all the ways possible, then they should should include all of the things we should try to avoid in order to save it.

The film "Cowspiracy" really opened my eyes into the food industry. I knew that animal-food production was extremely costly in terms of water, however, I did not know that this consumed 34 trillion gallons of water. For example, I learned that to produce a 1/4 pound burger would take up to 660 gallons of water. These incredibly high numbers and statistics are frightening and make me feel even more sure in my decision to eat a mainly plant based diet. However, what surprised me the most was the fishing industry. I did not know how detrimental fishing was to the ocean and wildlife. For instance, I learned that 40-50 million sharks get killed a year as result of fishing. Even companies like Oceana that advocate "sustainable fishing" also are culprits of this. 
<br><br>

This was another frightening element of the film. Kip explores why so many companies do not address the issue of the food industry in the climate crisis. The combination of methane from cows, water consumption, the emissions used to package and transport food, all are the reason for why this is the number two cause of greenhouse gas emissions. It's shocking that organizations do not look at this issue because they do not want to lose business. Ken did explain that Kip got a major statistic wrong in his film, but this does not personally delegitimize his argument to me. I still think that eating a plant based diet and not wasting food will drastically lower people's carbon footprint. I think there is enough research and proof to back this up. I hope that people can soon understand the implications of eating meat and fish, and why the decision not to could really help the planet.

Cowspiracy has definitely been my favorite film that we have watched throughout this course. I found the film to be not only very eye opening but also very emotional for me. In the midst of watching the film I actually made a group message with the members of my family and told them that we need to start cutting out meat and dairy from our diets. I told them that I understand how switching to a vegan lifestyle seems extreme but even a significant cut back could make a difference. What I found the most shocking was how so many organizations that claim that they want to save the planet would not even acknowledge the topic of agriculture and how it is the main cause of several issues relating to the climate crisis. What was even more shocking was the fact that some organizations refused to be interviewed altogether especially when these people claim to be "environmentalists" and environmentally aware. In all honesty, during some of the interviews the interviewees sounded so stupid to me while talking about meat production and how it is affecting the environment.One comment that made me laugh came from the woman that was raising free range animals. This woman was claiming that she cared about the environment and then literally said that she did not think that livestock animals had a carbon footprint. Like what? Overall this film was very shocking and honestly angered me more than anything.

I also agree that this has been my favorite film we have watched thus far. I've always known that livestock isn't good for the environment, but this film brought to light just how unsustainable this business is with its presentation about just how much land, farmable land at that, we need to sustain our country's demand on meat. This much land spreads throughout Canada, the US, Mexico and even South America, for ONLY what the US needs. However shocking it was to see all these environmental organizations brush off animal agriculture as a huge problem, it is understandable to keep their businesses popular and with funding. 

<br><br>

Trying to create a business out of environmental awareness needs to take a much different approach when trying to appeal to the public. I think this starts with very careful and effective education rather than an alarmist or punitive method. I was also baffled at the lady who said she doesn't believe that these animals do not have a carbon footprint. It made me wonder how someone could be so close to this industry yet not know the impacts it has on the environment and therefore our way of life. It was a prime example of the lack of education in this country and shows us what we all need to do if we are going to reverse this problem.

I remember watching Cowspiracy on Netflix when it was first released, I was about 13 or 14 at the time, and I remember it having such a large effect on me, I wanted to be vegan after that, but living in a household that does not know how to be vegan and eating basically whatever we wanted with no restrictions ever was so hard. I had no idea what to do and it became too hard so I decided to stop. Watching the film again still, had a huge affect on me, maybe not as strongly as it did when I was a child, I do although want to try reducing my meat consumption as much as possible, I do not think I am ready to fully give it up, as a 14 year old I had unrealistic expectations, but I need to move slowly into it. I also had the same feeling then and now about how the environmental organizations did not want to admit to agriculture being a big part of green house gas emissions, I was amazing about how all their reactions were the same, "I don't want to comment on that" or "I don't know". This time watching it I was also exposed or learned more. I don't remember the first time hearing about the death of the activist in Brazil and how these industrial farming groups were  literally threatening and killing these people telling the truth. Also the statistics through out  the film and how much more water livestock uses compared to people and fracking. I can't believe we spend so much food and water on these animals that we are only raising to kill when we have people dying of starvation and without clean water.

I had heard of the documentary "Cowspiracy" for so long, I mean probably since middle school, and I had never watched it until now. This documentary is such a gut punch, and it really makes you not only question the agriculture industry from a climate change perspective, but from an ethical and moral one as well. It reaffirms the idea in my head that our culture/society's perceived reliance on meat and the agriculture industry is only because those industries are dominated by greed and money. It's really easy for people to continue buying meat products when we've been told that they provide protein, are cheap, and are plentiful. It's also easy to fall in this trap when we don't have to see the behind the scenes process that goes into turning livestock into their respective meat products. 
<br><br>

It makes me, and I hope others too, question society's love for eating meat, and why more people don't at least attempt to add more plant-based meals into their diets when there are countless studies, documentaries, and more demonstrating the ill-effects that meat play on personal health and global health. This documentary definitely makes me reconsider my diet here, and what it's been like at home in a place where the industries are dominated by agriculture. I hope I can work towards incorporating much more plant-based meals into my diet.

Wasted! Is one of my favorite documentaries that we have seen in this class thus far. It was incredibly interesting and posed a new argument that I hadn’t been familiar with. Of course, I had heard of food waste being a contributor to climate change, yet I didn’t know the truth behind the argument.
<br><br>
Witnessing the amount of perfectly good food by supermarkets and restaurants made me frustrated because these businesses KNOW initially how much is going to be wasted. Supermarkets stack the shelves with more than they know they can sell to create the image of abundance in a consumer’s mind. My favorite part of the film was the introduction and story behind the grocery store called Daily Table. The idea that some communities simply don’t have access to, or cannot afford healthy foods or produce is a deprivation of a human right. Daily Table is an accessible solution, on the bus-line, takes discarded (yet perfectly good) food from supermarkets and resells them, and competes with the prices of other convenience stores. I absolutely love this idea. This is major progression.
<br><br>
Another part of the film that I enjoyed was watching chefs experiment with every part of a plant or animal in order to produce the least waste possible. Learning about the history of certain cultural dishes, and how many of them were created using scraps of animals and plants was incredibly interesting. I have such respect for those chefs, as they are redefining the way we perceive our food.
<br><br>
This film inspires me to be mindful of my consumption, waste, and where I put my dollar. I appreciated how at the end of the film, eco-friendly organizations and websites were listed. This is how to reach people, how to inspire, and make a true difference: providing outlets.

I feel the same as you do about the film Wasted because although it addresses an unfortunate issue, it tackled it in such a positive and motivating way. Because I’ve known about food waste being an issue, I didn’t really expect to learn anything new, but I definitely did and as a result, I feel differently about the typical grocery store. I kinda feel that a store like Albertson’s or Vons is equivalent to a fast fashion retailer like Forever 21 or Zara. They use the same brainwashing techniques to basically trick customers into overbuying.

<br><br>

As you said, the chefs talking about how they deal with mitigating food waste was really enjoyable and enlightening. Although I eat a plant-based diet, I can understand why they choose to consume basically the entirety of the animal. I guess if you’re going to consume animals then don’t be wasteful in the process. 

<br><br>

I agree that this film is doing it right: they present an issue, show various ways that people are dealing with it, and conclude with solutions for the viewer. I’m glad that issues like this that are often overlooked can get screen time and therefore reach many people that wouldn’t have otherwise known about it.

Before watching this film, I was already aware of the negative effects of having such an abundant amount of livestock. However, I did not know this number was around 70 billion animals being raised to provide food. It really put things in perspective regarding how much unnecessary  meat we eat, dairy we consume, and other animal based foods we include into our everyday lives. As mentioned in the film, no human being would go hungry if  we used the resources ranchers use to feed their livestock to feed the rest of the world. Despite Kip Anderson getting the facts wrong, his message about the ignorance of agricultural impact on the planet did not undercut the credibility of the film. It just goes to show that the agribusiness has done such a good job of hiding the problem that not a lot of researchers are able to produce accurate numbers and despite being such a high number at 50%, no organization leader looked or sounded surprised at the number. As shown in the film, no environmental organization wanted to talk about the real issue because they are being run like businesses. This makes me second guess the environmental organizations I support and made me realize that I have to do research before supporting an organization. The film made it clear that the government is also at the root of the problem and even encourages the production of meat, most likely because of the high profits. Unfortunately, money is always a priority. 
<br><br>
The film emphasizes that the livestock problem is dangerous and large scale. It’s time for the government to realize that making a change now to reverse climate change will be a lot less expensive than having to fix the earth when it is too late.

My first reaction to the film was very emotional because I wasn't aware of just how big of an impact the meat industry is having on the planet, but now that I know it isn't as large as an issue as it was made out to be. It made me feel pretty sad about the current state of the environment, but also a little hopeful that maybe this film can help make a difference.  I knew of the issue before, but through this film, I also learned things that I could do to make a positive impact in the world.  Seeing the community gardens that are being started and how much food gets produced through them makes me very optimistic and encouraged me to start my own raised bed.  I already eat a plant-based diet, but after watching this film I am going to be more conscious of how I exist in the world and the things that I choose to consume.  Watching and learning of the horrible conditions of the meat and dairy industry makes me want to do something for the world, and I feel optimistic for the future because I feel like my generation is full of people who want to make a difference and better the world. I think the film was effective at communicating its message with its presentation of the harsh truths and realities of the meat industry that I feel most viewers weren't previously aware of.  I think that the visual graphics used when presenting the facts helped solidify what the producer was trying to say and impact the viewer in a bigger way.  some of the graphic videos of what some farms actually look and operate like were pretty gnarly, especially when showing the inhumane treatment of the animals and videos of animals being slaughtered. That part for me was the hardest to watch.  I think that Anderson had good intentions when he used false information, just because it is a huge issue and he wanted to make sure that his message got across.  The film seems directed towards people who had no, or very little, prior knowledge of the meat industry, but also for people who already consider themselves well informed because it is very informative which makes it ideal for casual viewers because it introduces them to the issue.  It is still very informative for people who are already concerned about the issue and could introduce them to things that they might've not known about.

On one of the websites where the film of Cowspiracy has been uploaded, I saw several comments say the situation and severity expressed in the film are not trustworthy at all and lack of scientific evidence, and they appeal to delete this kind of disinformation from the website. I told my friend what I see from these comments, and my friend, who is also taking Ken’s class, said that even she wouldn’t believe in these cruel truth if she didn’t take the class and had some knowledge on the topic of climate change. 

<br><br>

Then I realized that this is such an unbelievable yet believable truth. Cows, the primary supplier of milk and meat, could contribute to 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. When Cowspiracy and Wasted combine, they serve to enlighten us on the idea of the correct solution. Instead of switching to the plant-based diet, we need to waste less. And just like Ken mentioned in the video, the appearance of freegan and freeganism, which is the opposite of consumerism, brings hope and could be another possible solution if once popularized.



</p><hr>


<p>

From the moment that I watched the film, I knew that it was a challenge for me because my life cannot be with meat. Watching the film is a chance for me to educate me and change my heart. The first-person view leads me into Kip’s story and his efforts towards reducing carbon emissions. To be honest, it’s easier for me to embrace what kip says with an open-minded heart. 
<br><br>

From the film, I know that livestock industries emit the same amount of carbon dioxide every year as livestock industries do. Diary and animals cost water-intensive grains to eat so that is why they cost much water every year. What’s even more staggering to me is (quote) that domestic water use is only 5% of what is consumed in us while animal agriculture takes up 55% of annual water use in the US. The jarring statistics and bar charts clearly show us how many resources livestock industries would use and how many potential methanes would emit. When kip found out that government websites related to saving water without mentioning the disadvantages of animal agriculture, he tried to connect the government which involved environmental protection. 
<br><br>

Then, the interesting point is when an official of the water resources government said that “because of the way government is set up here.” The official avoided to talk about the issue and excused by the setting of government. It is true that the government is somehow unfair and does not tell the truth. He as a person in charge also refuses to answer and face the issue of water-saving. The official is silent facing the issue of livestock industries. If everyone is like what he does, we cannot save ourselves finally. 
<br><br>

Members of environmental organizations do not want to challenge people and they want funding to support their business to operate. Then, they lie to people that the real driving cause of climate crisis is animal agriculture. 
<br><br>

After watching two-thirds of the film, I’ve been realized that animal agriculture that is the leading driver to threat the environment including Amazon rainforests is a truth. Most responsibilities of environmental nonprofit organizations’ silences are truths, too. The corporation between meat producers and nonprofit organizations are truths, too. Many environmental activists have been dead of speaking out the truth. Kip, the director of the film “Cowspiracy” also faces such fear and worries but he says that “now you either live for something or die for nothing.” I know his decision and I admire him a lot. It is not easy for him to make a decision when he knows that he is putting his head on the guillotine. 
<br><br>

Now, I’ve changed my mind. It is the issue of whether you like to eat meat or not. It is now about you should not eat more meat and provide profits to meat companies and let them destroy the earth. Plus, it is saying that there 15 times more protein that can be gained through plant-based food. I believe that the film can inspire a lot more people like me and what we really need to do is to change our diet.



</p><hr>


<p>

The film Cowspiracy I felt like promoted me to actually make environmentally conscious changes in my daily life much more than the other films I have watched for this class. It gave some very scary statistics about the meat industry even saying at one point that "a hamburger is the equivalent of the water usage from showering for 2 months" which seemed quite outrageous to me but I didn't really question it during the film, most likely because of all of the suspicious reactions corporations were giving after being asked about agriculture being a number one cause of climate change. The way the film was set up, made me instantly be on his side as we basically went through the journey of interviewing all of these different organizations in hope to answer the same question of why no one was saying anything about agriculture.

<br><br>

With all of these interviews being done by an average young person, it offered true insight on what the perspectives of all these organizations really were and opened my eyes to the ever so corrupt parts of businesses and governments in which corporations are getting away with literally murdering people who are trying to slow them down in effort to save the environment and reduce climate change. I feel as if a lot of the protests and efforts to turn corporations into environmentally conscious are ineffective as there is no true incentive for them and the only incentive they can really get is from federal policy forcing them. If governments don't take action to force corporations, especially the ones in part of the agriculture industry, to change their operations to be in line with reducing climate change I feel that there won't be any change significant enough to prevent this impending crisis.

First of all, I’m really enjoying all of these documentaries so far as they have proven to be very informative and teach me things that I hadn’t thought about on a deeper aspect. But Ken really needs to start putting trigger warnings or something before these documentaries because the scenes are really shocking, and that’s probably intended for the film, but this movie was the second time I was just thinking how unbelievable. The film we watched a week before, The True Cost, had the one scene of the guy drenched in blood and it’s heartbreaking but I feel like it’s so sudden. I understand the message of the film, but showing the execution of a duck? Is it necessary? And showing us the close ups of the blood? 
<br><br>
Other than that, I was really shocked at how many environmental groups weren’t talking about a\the research Kip found regarding agriculture, and how most of them turned him away. It felt like a betrayal, that even environmentalist groups are in for some sort of profits. The part of the film where his fundings were cut just showed how afraid people were of the truth. I wonder if the filmmaker has met anything other than the usual criticism since the film’s release.
<br><br>
What also struck me was the part when the guy said how “you can’t call yourself an environmentalist and eat animal products, period.” Sometimes people eat meat because they have to, and feel the effects of veganism once they’ve switched, like feeling weak. Still, ever since Ken noted that eating a burger is like driving 20 miles, it’s something I can’t stop thinking about.

I think that I understand some of your concerns. Some of these scenes do seem somewhat unnecessary. Still, the shock factor that it provides to people who may have never thought about what they are putting into themselves is what is essential. It really forces them to think about what they are eating and how it is affecting living things, nature, and the climate. I do somewhat disagree with the part that says you cant call your self an environmentalists and still eat meat. I do think that that is true for beef and mutton, two of the most resource intensive meats, but we can eat meat scarcely and still not have a large carbon foot print or a big detrimental impact on the environment. 

<br><br>

We can eat fish and other seafood (which I believe should still  be classified as meat). I think it can be difficult for some people to cope with having to eliminate an entire part of their diet form their life but I think phrasing it as eating only what you can raise would help greatly. This would mean that the majority of Americans eat meat only two or three times over a month. I think this solution is much more viable to have the american people adapt to as it would not seem like that big of a step but would accomplish reducing our carbon footprint as a result of our agriculture many times over.

I heard that Cowspiracy had exaggerated some stuff, so when I was watching it, I was constantly doubting almost everything I heard from Kip Anderson. It didn't help that he was asking so many pointed questions and constantly emphasizing that there was a conspiracy, a 'cowspiracy.' Out of everything I've read on the climate crisis, I find this documentary to be the most alarmist. Based off Project Drawdown's ranking, the documentary isn't that alarmist because the reality Kip Anderson presents is pretty much true, besides the exaggeration of percentage. Even if he exaggerated, it's true that not many leaders of environmental organizations want to discuss the issue. Yet, the way he presents the information makes everything seem overly alarmist and makes me feel skeptical. I want to believe his message despite how harsh the truth is, but the way he presents it makes me doubt him. Instead of presenting the issue like a conspiracy theory, which is more admittedly more interesting, I feel that a more unbiased presentation would be more effective at communicating the issue, even if he kept the exaggerated percentage. I could overlook an exaggerated percentage if everything else seemed serious and unbiased, but the combination of exaggeration and the way he aggressively asked pointed questions, among other factors, made me paranoid about how much bias and exaggeration there was in the film, making it hard for me to believe him.
<br><br>

I do like the opening of the film; it really drives the whole point of the documentary home. There were many good points spoken in the documentary. I did find the death of the duck a bit unnecessary, since it was a bit of a tangent. I also thought that the one person who said that Americans shouldn't consider themselves environmentalists unless they're vegans to be a bit extreme, since it would push away some people who want to try helping the environment but aren't willing to give up animal products (it reminded me of how a student had great lifestyle choices, but flew often). Every little bit counts, and such a strong statement might even prevent budding environmentalists from eventually going vegan. 
<br><br>

I was shocked by how activists were actively harmed. In Merchants of Doubt and Climate of Doubt, there were threats to climate scientists, but nothing physical actually happened to them, at least not in the documentaries. I was quite surprised to hear that animal rights and environmental activists are the "number one domestic terrorism threat according to the FBI," since I haven't heard any violence come from activists (gluing yourself to an airplane is extreme, but not violent). I knew deep down that it's impossible for industries with such power to be 100% clean and not pull some strings, but I didn't expect them to be silencing people who want to spread information. It reminds me of the tobacco industry keeping quiet about smoking and lung cancer. Also,  I didn't expect American activists, although not in the U.S., to be gunned down. It wasn't even a death at a riot or a heated protest, but just something that seemed almost casual, which made it feel worse because of how unexpected it was. 
<br><br>
It might be dangerous to stand up for an issue when no one else does, similar to how "the nail that sticks up gets hammered down," but if there's enough people standing up, the government and corporations will eventually have to bend because the people, however indirectly, give them their power.

"Cowspiracy" was extremely eye opening for me. Like many of the comments on this video, I learned that much of what I thought I knew before was actually wrong. I knew that agriculture definitely had a huge impact on the climate crisis, like the effect cows have, but I had no idea that it was worse, even when compared to the fossil fuel industry. It made be curious as to why I had no idea, and why so many other people in these comments didn't know either. I actually barely thought about the impact food made and had my main focus on fossil fuels. The film answered many questions for me. 
<br><br>
I know how bad cows are for the environment. I personally have not completely cut out beef in my diet yet, but I have started to reduce my beef consumption to reduce my carbon footprint. I've stated to choose alternatives and have even started dabbling in vegan substitutes. My sister has tried to go vegetarian about three times now, and failed perviously because my family was unsupportive and were the primary food providers. Recently this last year, she went vegetarian again for environmental and ethical reasons, and she has been successful since then! It really inspired me because my entire family was against it and consumes meat at every meal, yet she pushed through! It's been interesting to talk to her about the change and I've learned a lot from her. 
<br><br>
"Cowspiracy" was very informative and I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of interviews. Yes, they were infuriating to watch because of the denial and blame displacement, but I learned so much about how these organizations hide and sweep the statistics under the rug. This leads me to think that there are so many lies circling the climate crisis. What can people trust to be green and good for the environment if organizations seen to be driven by other things outside of simply helping the environment.

I agree. I always assumed that switching to a plant based diet would create a minor reduction in my ecological in footprint, but Conspiracy really showed the extent that a meat filled diet can wreck havoc on the environment.  The most shocking part for me was how much space is being accommodated to host cows and the impact that has directly on the environment.

<br><br>

I think that beef consumption can be lowered through informative media, such as movie. One really big driving force will also be health concerns and how widespread they become. Within the past couple of years, studies have came out discussing the ties between frequent red meat consumption and health issues, especially cancer. I think that these will be the overwhelming force in lowering their consumption. Also removing some of the subsidies that keep the price so low will indisputably lower consumption. 
<br><br>


As someone who eats a primary meat based diet and has refused to completely phase out meats like your sister, I have been progress in lowering my red meat consumption to once or twice a week for health reasons. However after watching this documentary, I will try to further reduce my consumption because the problem really is outrageously disproportional relative to other environmentally taxing activities.

Just like you, after watching this film I had an introspective moment. I had no idea of the environmental destruction livestock had on the earth and, like you, wondered why I had such a hard time finding this truth. As pointed out in the film, I feel like I had been one of the people lied to by these huge mega-corporations, telling me that their products were eco-friendly when they're really not (starting from a very young age).
<br><br>
Part of the reason I had decided to cut out meat from my diet (starting in high school), was firstly for ethical reasons. I knew that the treatment of cows and chicken was so disgusting and terrible. When I found out (through a documentary) that as soon as a calf was born that she is taken away from her mother, it had made me anxious, angry, and disappointed. When cutting out meat from my diet, I still had no idea of the huge environmental impact that livestock carries. I always had believed that the fossil fuel industry was most likely the top contributor to global warming, even on my vegetarian diet. Questions that I think about today are; How could I have known? Why did I not know? And If I didn't know, how many people in the general population are still blinded to this fact?
<br><br>
Just like your sister, I also had a very difficult time becoming a vegetarian living with my parents. As they come from a family of meat eaters, and so the concept of eating meat is ingrained into their culture. It was definitely difficult living around people so in love with meat, but now I think to myself; Was it really their fault?

I watched “Wasted! The Story of Food Waste” a year ago, and appreciated it very much. Now, I having watched “Cowspiracy”, I appreciate the reminder to keep choosing vegan as much as possible. When I say “as much as possible” I am referring to the idea of flexitarianism (something I initially called “feganism”, as in “fake” or “flexible” vegan). I eat vegan when I can, but “flex” for exceptions. Because I care about food not being wasted, I want to make sure that all the resources being used to create each item of food--vegan or not--isn’t going to waste or at least not ending up in landfill. It has come to my attention that this resembles some principles of freeganism, of which I know less about. I would love to learn more about it (especially about how it works and how I can implement it into my life). 
<br><br>

I am not affiliated with any religion, but I believe that the slaughtering of animals is a type of sacrifice mode for our sake. Though many (including vegans) would claim it cruel to slaughter and eat animals, I think it is even more cruel to let the meat of those same animals go to waste. This is similar to that of the fashion industry. If it takes so much water (and other resources) to create a single article of clothing, we should be appreciating that article of clothing to the fullest. The “Minimalism” documentary mentions how we are not a truly materialistic society, because of our tendency to devalue and toss out our material belongings. We have been disconnected with our food just like we have been disconnected with our material goods. We see this happen when the children of the ranchers talk about loving pigs but the issue with bonding with them. We see this with the naming of meat as “beef” and “pork” rather than using “cow” or “pig” on packaging. I think Kip Anderson’s comment on how he wouldn’t be able to kill a duck for himself does a great job addressing this concept of disconnect in our culture.

I liked your connection between the different films we’ve watched in the course between these two and Minimalism. It’s really important I think to note the common theme amongst each of these issues, fast fashion, food waste, etc. and you state it very eloquently. By now we are all aware of the fact that our consumerist Westernized culture has brought about this major waste problem, but we haven’t talked about how it’s deep rooted in our disconnection to the products we buy. No longer are the days before this modern era where we produce our own textiles and produce and create our food and clothes ourselves. 
<br><br>

I think in order to address this disconnect, Cowspiracy does a great job in showcasing what the reality is of eating meat. In addition, Wasted! does a great job in showcasing these high profile chefs who even take the initiative to question what more we can be doing with our food that is typically wasted. For regular individuals who are skeptical of the climate crisis, I think it’ll be difficult to bridge that disconnect without them having to go back to olden ages. I find that most people who are willing to switch to a largely plant-based diet and take other personal action already believe in the climate crisis whether due to political values or not. Communicating this dire need for personal action from the skeptics is my only reservation about this.

Watching this film was really hard for me, mostly because I've always been apprehensive about meat eating. About a year and a half ago, I started decreasing my meat consumption, and I’ve been vegan ever since. At first, it was mostly about what I was eating, as I’d never really like meat before and I was excited to be able to live meat-free. However it quickly came to my attention that going vegan has so many more benefits beyond animal rights, the biggest one being the environmental impacts. It feels really good to know that I am aiding in some way to combat the constant growth of CO2 in our atmosphere by doing something I was already implementing in my day to day life. 
<br><br>

While I hope this video encourages people to limit their meat consumption, I don’t believe it will. Eating meat has become as much of a right to us as free parking, and some people are not at all willing to even consider the pros and cons of having a meat-free diet. Even in my last relationship, one of our biggest disagreements was about veganism and the effect it can have combating the climate crisis. There are also cultural roots in food, and many people will not consider switching to a plant based diet because they believe it will mean abandoning their culture in some way. While going vegan was easy for me, I understand why some people are so apprehensive. Nevertheless, there are too many meat alternatives for us not to limit our meat intake, especially if it would help save our planet.

The film “Wasted!” focuses on the issue of the huge waste of food seen throughout the world. The film lets us know how the waste of food is a huge environmental issue. I did find the film to be a bit repetitive at some points, but overall it is a great film that serves its purpose. 
 <br><br>
I really liked how the film uses a pyramid to give the viewers different options and different purposes for their food. At the top of the pyramid we see that we should try our best to use as much of the food to feed humans. After that, it is to feed animals. The third part of the pyramid is to use the food for renewable energy. The fourth part is to use the food as compost, and the final part (the worst thing to do) is for it to go to the landfill. Unfortunately, most of the food that is wasted ends up in our landfill. This causes harm to our plant because all the wasted food in the landfill produces methane. 
<br><br>
 The film also shows us how some cooks use unwanted parts of some vegetables and animals to make delicious meals. They show a great appreciation and gratitude for all the food that is available for them to consume. This is what a majority of the people lack, true appreciation and gratitude for food. The great percentage of people that waste a lot of food aren’t grateful for being blessed enough to be able to purchase enough food for themselves, unlike billions of poor people around the world in third world countries.

Thanks for Ken's clarification on the contribution of raising livestock. I was pretty much freak out that this problem and its solution are not in the first one of the suggestions to save us from the climate crisis. I was wondering how could it be that they did not even mention in the list when the livestock has raised so many issues?
<br><br>


However, a second thought came to me. The 15 percent is still not a small deal. How could those agriculture companies still not know about this bad effect and think again about what they have done? Well, the answer is pretty simple. People's demand is in the market, so there is supply. The meal with simply only the vegetables is obviously not a good idea for a person who has just done his or her super heavy work. It is just not as enjoyable as eating meat. I would try to eat more vegetables only when necessary, for example, there are ulcers grow in my mouth.

The film Cowspiracy leaves me with a heavy heart. I believe it was a good approach for the filmmaker to take on a perspective as one who was trying to seek out all the answers and answer his confusions. While this is quite an eye-opener for me, I was extremely shook and terrified at these enormous numbers. And what’s driving that number is not only happening right now, but also would only help increase these digits. I had never thought agriculture would be such a big problem across the globe, and all the devastating effect it had brought to the environment and climate. And this is not only on the land. According to the film, quite a few areas of ocean had become bio-dead zones thanks to the toxic substances being released into water due farming. In addition to that, I never knew the massive scale of fishing, and the collateral effect it has on other species, and it shook me more that by 2048 we would have 0 fishes in the ocean. 
<br><br>


On the other hand, what triggers me more is the lack of acting against these issues, especially on animal husbandry. It is shocking yet devastating that almost not a single environmental organization would be willing to admit that cattle ranching is the No.1 causes for most of the environmental degradation and destruction in the world. Of course they would be well-aware of it, it’s just nobody wants to be the one that openly talk about it. I think the analogy about the binge drinking husband in the family one guy draw was fairly accurate when talking about these organizations’ attitudes. They want to maintain their prestige and financial support, and for that, ironically, they become the enemy of their own. On one side they were trying to prevent climate change, but they won’t even address, or even talk about the biggest issue on climate change. And that’s very heart-sinking for me.

Wasted! The Story of Food Waste was one of my favorite movies that we have watched in this class. I think food waste is a huge component in climate change that often goes unnoticed by people. The statistics provided in this film were shocking to hear 40% of food produced is going to waste and over 90% of wasted food goes straight to landfills. It is crazy to think about the fact that there are 800 million people starving around the world, however, we could easily feed them with the amount of food we let go to waste. I thought it was super interesting to see the creative alternative people have implemented to fight food waste. For example, Dan Barber a chef and co-owner of Blue Hill in Manhattan and Blue Hill at Stone Barns implements his farm to table movement as well as nose to tail movement. Basically, Barber is promoting using every part of the animal and not just certain parts. He also frequently visits farms and finds a way to incorporate every part of vegetables and fruits that people often dismiss. It was also interesting to look into Daily Table, which is a non-profit grocery store launched by Doug Rauch who was the former president of Trader Joe’s. Daily Table recovers food from supermarkets, and growers that would most like end up as waste and provides it back to communities in need. It also blew my mind to learn about expiration dates and codes and how most of them are simply a way for stores to rotate products. Food waste is just one way we can help battle climate change and is one of the easier ways exemplified by the creative implementations mentioned in this film.

This film was very frustrating to watch, especially the first half, when it was basically people evading his questions. I felt it was useless. Knowing that they lied about 50% of emissions are from animal agriculture, I don’t know how much of their arguments I should take seriously. However, they bring up an interesting point that helps answer a question I had while reading project drawdown: “If these solutions are so effective, why is it that we only hear about “switching to LED” or “take shorter showers”? Part of it is because the beef industry wants you to keep supporting their products. Like the fossil fuel companies, animal agriculture has influence on politics. They also attack activists by killing them, similar to how American Tradition Institute used emails against scientists. I didn’t like how Andersen’s main goal is to get the viewers to feel bad for animals. Like the duck slaughter scene. He doesn’t even address other issues like how it’d cost more carbon-wise to eat asparagus in the winter than to eat chicken or pork. I didn’t like this documentary. It was not very fact-based and tried too hard to get me to feel bad for animals instead of solving climate change. Despite all the unnecessary scenes, there are some valuable things I took, like how it’s similar to the fossil fuel industry. I really don’t know how to prevent these issues. It’s a recurring problem. Rich companies, be it tobacco, beef, or fossil fuels. profit off of hurting others and use their money to get political power and silence activists. This also relates to project drawdown in that it provides information on land use, such as how more land than America would have to be used for cattle ranges to feed our eating habits. I remember learning in lecture about how humans and their animals take up 80% of landmass. The Amazon forest is being burned to get land for meat. The Amazon forest is an important carbon sink and is part of the top 25 effective changes in Project Drawdown.

This documentary truly opened my eyes when it comes to both the agriculture/life stock industry and environmental industry. I found it very scary that even with the people and groups we expect to be fighting for our environment still work with in the same vein of prioritizing their public image and appeal over the facts. Kip's interviews (and lack thereof) astounded me because these big environmental groups either had no idea about the impact of that the agricultural sector, or wanted to deny it as some minor issue. It might not be a conspiracy in regards to just environmental groups, as in they aren't gunning down people to keep them quiet on the matter, but theres a big issue when the clear facts and strategies are there to combat climate change and we are deliberately electing to ignore them. 
<br><br>

By the end, I am truly reaffirmed that no matter how we look at the climate change crisis, it's going to be a hard pill to swallow. It's going to become increasingly more and more important that we learn to read between the lines and find out the reasons why things are going on, like Kip did through this documentary. A great example of this is the whole concept of organic or pasteurized milk. My whole life I was raised with the idea that organic was the way to go! GMOs will kill you! I never even thought about the environmental side to the use of biological advancements in agriculture and creating true sustainability. 
<br><br>

Regardless of how you look at something like the agriculture industry, fish industry, or organic vs genetically modified, one fact is becoming more and more clear in my head: becoming vegan is the way to go. It's something i'm not sure i can achieve, but definitely a goal i want to work towards.

after watching "cowspiracy", I have noticed that it had a great negative influence on livestock and meat industry. Ken mentioned that one quarter pound hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to produce and by knowing this fact, I would reconsider before I purchase one. Besides, I think this film did an amazing job on emphasizing the negative facts of beef consumption and illustrating the fact that it has led to deforestation and environmental damaging. Also, it revealed how severe the problem of food wasting is. It is time for us to do something in order to make our environment a better place to live.




</p><hr>


<p>

After viewing the film, I was impressed by the courage the filmmaker Anderson indicated in making this documentary but was also concerned about the way he presented his argument and the fact that these arguments are not backed by deeper analysis and scientific results.
<br><br>

To my relief, Ken pointed out the part of the facts in film with less deliberateness. In addition, I have more to say about the fact that being a Freegan is far more beneficial to the environment than being a vegan. In the documentary, Anderson simply proved that being vegan is as beneficial or even more beneficial to our health when compared with having a diet with meat by quoting the interview with a physician in a certain health center. I’m not saying that this physician is overstating the benefits of a vegan diet, but there is a huge gap in the type and quantity of micronutrients between meat and vegetables. I’ve seen someone born and raised in a non-vegan family feeling less energetic in life and feeling depressed when switching into a vegan diet, whose problems disappear as soon as he switches back. Therefore, adapting a vegan diet has various impacts on various people, the argument that pregnant women and patients should not have any concern when adapting a vegan diet should not be presented with such little background research.
<br><br>

In addition, the film keeps stating that we should be aware of the power of megacompanies producing food for they control the voices of environmental organizations by funding them and thus asking them to hide the fact that animal agriculture accounts for a big proportion of greenhouse gas emission globally. However, we should think of this issue from multiple angles. Given that those companies devoted so much in making people believe in this idea, would it be possible that vegan is also an idea propelled by companies making supplements and vegan foods?



</p><hr>


<p>
As I was watching Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret, I examined each possibility that was presented in the film in terms of eating styles and practices. Nonetheless, they were all pretty much dead to our planet as to how much water they require. What was even more shocking was seeing the journalist interviewing major environmental organizations about the effects cattle farming has, and seeing them reject to further help him. They all refused to intervene and get involved with that topic, which was later explained to be due to the number of power cattle farmers had. Apparently, there is a law that states that a person will be deemed guilty and charged if they speak out against the cattle industry on television or any media. This could explain why no one dares to go against them, even though they know this to be the main cause of carbon emission and water waste.

<br><br>

Although I do believe we should all modify our diet and be as vegan as possible,  I would understand if some people decided to eat meat, chicken, or fish every now and then. As long as that chicken was home raised, and that fish was personally fished out of the water. Like it was mentioned in the film, humans have lost their connection to food, to animals. I do not see any problem with the man who raised a duck farm and when the time came, killed some to eat. He is aware of the amount of time and work it takes to raise a duck, but when the time comes takes the responsibility to kill it himself. Although it may seem a bit harsh, I think this is more humane than mindlessly going to a grocery store and picking a packet of meat to use for dinner. It teaches you the value of life and food.

When watching the film “Cowspiracy” it made me question myself and how much meat that is eaten within my family. Within my family’s culture, meat is served with many dishes and it is something that is constantly bought and served. I have known from a younger age than the process of the meat industry isn’t the best and it does much damage, being completely ugly. But, seeing these thoughts and assumptions in play by seeing actual footage, it was something completely different. I have been vegetarian before but seeing this makes me reconsider leaving it. Meat is good yes, but if it is at the expense of worsting the planet that not only I am living in, but others as well, I would prefer to help the planet. When hearing that the process of raising the farm animals released so much carbon into the atmosphere, the only logical thing to do in my head was to cut down by eating less meat. I do believe, however, that Kip Anderson including false information within the film was more detrimental than good. Yes, it did cause the alarmist tactic, but if many people learn that the facts talked about were false, then I believe they are more likely to just dismiss them in general.

My family eats so much meat. In fact, I can't think of a single person who is vegetarian or vegan. I grew up eating meat, too. Unlike you, I had no idea how bad the meat industry was until coming to college. This movie blew my mind. 
<br><br>

At first I thought that Kip's alarmist tactic was good, but I'm starting to reconsider. There is already so much scrutiny on climate activists, and false "facts" only hurt our cause.

"Cowspiracy" can be easily described as an informative film that exposes the meat industry and how detrimental it is to the environment. As the film blasts many statistics on how going vegan could not only save the environment and our own body health, the film provides questionable statistics that can seem as alarming to many. I understand that refraining from having meat in our diet could potentially save the earth as it requires less water, land, and basically resources, however the information in the film seem heavily biased and questionable to many other viewers. I agree that we should complete the goals that the film pushed viewers to accomplish, however that information strongly attacks the film's credibility to those who don't fully understand the situation of the meat industry or those who were raised consuming meat and don't really see what their effect on the environment is.

The film “Cowspiracy” was very interesting to watch. I found certain things like how none of the environmental groups that Anderson talked to wanted to bring up cows and their impact on their own. It was always Anderson that had to ask more specific questions about the agriculture industry to get these groups to address the issue or in many cases not address it. This kind of made me question why so many of these groups did not find animal agriculture to be the leading cause of greenhouse gases being put into the world as well as deforestation, water consumption, and ocean pollution. How could the leaders of well known environmental groups not know these facts and numbers and not want to talk about them. This left me confused until I watched Ken’s lecture and heard that animal agriculture accounts for 15% of global greenhouse gasses. I found this frustrating and I think it explains many of the reactions he got. I think that it is more important to have accurate information that people can trust rather than creating a more dramatic effect. I think to find this out ultimately made me rethink all the other numbers and statistics that were brought up throughout the film and think were they true? Because of this misinformation, I feel it discredits Anderson. With that said, I do think that it is important to recognize that this film can be very impactful. It speaks about an issue that I feel has oftentimes been put on the back burner. I am not exactly sure why that is, because it is a clear issue and more and more people are acknowledging it but many other issues like cars and energy efficiency seem to appear much more.

I also had the some doubts as you just wondering why won’t environmentalist organization directly address the issue of animal agriculture and the impacts from this industry. After some time spent pondering about this issue, I thought these environmentalist organizations either 1. were silenced as the industry truly hold so much power as described in the film or 2. are so uninformed about the issue as they focus on their mission statement. As much as I would like to not believe it, scenario 1 seems more probable, but then again I thought about how Oceana in the film claimed that the best way to save fisheries is by consuming more fishes. This made me think of how some of these organizations could definitely be unaware of issues outside of their expertise as it seems like some of them lack even the knowledge of the matter required to protect what they aim to preserve. If scenario 2 was true, I think the world ought to be educated about the issue on a larger scale. Regarding the credibility of Anderson, I would still believe most of his statistics are reliable even though there is one discrepancy pointed out by Ken. Most of the statistics seem to align with similar statistics I’ve learned about in this class.

I thought that this week’s film, just as all of the films we have watched before, was extremely interesting and impactful. I feel much more motivated to switch to a plant-based diet after watching it and I am very excited about all of the new knowledge I have accumulated about the benefits of making this switch. The statistics that really stood out to me, while watching, were about the amount of water and food all 7 billion of us in America consume, compared to our livestock. These numbers were mind boggling. I remember learning about this in SOC 1 last quarter: the fact that we produce enough food for everyone to be fat, but world hunger exists because we are feeding our livestock instead of our poor. In the film Cowspiracy, this statement was explained in much further detail and along the lines of the negative effects this has on our nation’s growing GHG emissions. As explained in the film, the fact is that we are making enough food to support around 12-13 billion people, but our nation only consists of about 7 billion. What is even worse, is that roughly a billion of them are in fact starving. This is because, according to the film, 50% of the legumes and grain we are growing, are being fed to animals. This is so disheartening and makes me sad to say that our nation is failing in the agricultural department as well as at bringing an end to world hunger. 
<br><br>
I also found the way our government is addressing this issue to be very upsetting. When asked about the negative effects our nation’s livestock have on our accumulated carbon footprint, people in government and corporations tend to avoid an answer or say that the problem isn’t really animal agriculture, it is human overpopulation. But Cowspiracy explains that, in fact, the issue is “human-eating-animals population.” I especially liked the way that the film explained the problem with this: “Environmental organizations not addressing this, is like health organizations trying to stop lung cancer without addressing smoking. And instead of second-hand smoking, it’s second-hand eating.” This quote really put all of the facts into perspective for me. I feel like there has been a pattern among the sources of the climate crisis, that have been revealing themselves throughout the course: it is our nation’s government and societal system that is at the core of the problem. As a result, the up and coming generation of eco-conscious millennials is left without much to do about the situation, as we need drastic systemic change in order to make an actual difference in our future. Cowspiracy did a wonderful job of selling the solution of switching, nation-wide, to a plant-based diet and the decrease in livestock that is needed to save our planet.

After watching the film “Wasted!”, I learned that there’s five stages of how we can handle food and where food can go after they were being dumped into the trash. The first stage is simple, feeding food to people. And if we don’t take in the food, we feed it to animals like pigs and chickens. The next stage is the one that surprised me the most, which is transforming food waste into renewable energy through the process of anaerobic digestion. And if all of the above strategies don't work or do not apply, we could transform the food waste into compost, which could then become healthy soil to grow plants and crops. The thing we should never do is to dump the wasted food into a landfill. This process will create a greenhouse gas which is 23 times stronger than carbon, and become a more serious problem than the wasting of food. 
<br><br>
I also learned that there are approximately 1 trillion worth of food dumped by us yearly while there’s still a lot of people facing hunger problems or starving to death. This made me feel very confused because the problem of starvation and food wasting could definitely become the solution for each other. It is often the  developing countries who’s facing hunger issues and developed countries facing wasted food issues.

The fact that there are approximately 1 trillion dollars of food dumped annually also caught me by surprise. On one hand, we have movements to end world hunger while on the other we have countries around the world wasting food that could be used to feed others who suffer from lack of food. This approach is very counter intuitive - how can we say that we are making a legitimate effort to help developing nations who need food when we are simply squandering away the resources that they need access to? I also found the statistic that dumping food into a landfill is a process that creates greenhouse gases that are 23 times stronger than carbon also very eye opening. I did not realize that wasting food not only harmed people around the world who had limited access to food but also affected the environment in a very negative way. The waste of food, as seen in the film "Wasted" has been consistent through out human history and something definitely needs to be done if we are serious about solving both the climate crisis and human hunger crisis. Mobile applications like Olio, which helps to connect neighbors and local retailers so surplus food can be shared and not disposed of, are definitely a step in the right direction. However, we need more people to become aware and use practices like the ones used in Olio to have a bigger global impact.

Watching the film "Cowspiracy" was a MAJOR eye opener for me. Although we have talked in depth about how harmful the beef/agricultural industry is in class, this film really showed first hand/explained the harmfulness of the industry. Although I try to avoid red meat as much as possible, I'm still guilty of the occasional In n Out craving- which, after watching this film, I am also going to try to avoid. As the top comment on this page said, I was absolutely baffled when one of the people interviewed in the film said that the reason they are in the meat industry is because they "love animals". The people that run these organizations are so incredibly ignorant and financially motivated, which blinds them not only to the environmental effects of their industry, but the ethical ones too. 
<br><br>

Overall, after seeing the disgusting nature of the beef industry and learning a lot of statistics about just how harmful it really is, I am going to try to completely cut red meat out of my diet. I am also going to encourage my friends to do the same. Like we have talked about in class, if everyone just cut down their beef intake by a fraction, it would have a major environmental impact- and I fully believe that more people need to see this film in order to understand the gravity of the situation. I am glad I was able to watch this film- Kip did an amazing job exposing the industry.

Wasted was such an eye opening movie! I already know how to compost and the benefits of generating power, but I had no idea that you could turn good scraps into a magical juice to feed pigs. That was my favorite part of the movie! I wish we did that here in america instead of only giving them corn and soy products alongside antibiotics. It also occurred to me that since the pigs were eating ‘recycled’ food, eating those certain pigs is not bad for the environment at all. Maybe it would be a different story with cows because they produce a lot more methane. 
<br><br>
I think that every city in the world should require by law that it is illegal for stores and restaurants to waste food, and that all citizens must compost sorta like South Korea. 
<br><br>
I agree that being freegan is great, but it seems hard to do and highly time consuming, trying to coordinate with local stores and restaurants. Most places probably already have designated freegans picking up their scraps, or are too afraid that they will be sued by someone getting sick that they would not want to in the first place.

The documentary "Cowspiracy" really opened my eyes to what truly happens behind the scenes of the food industry. After learning about the harmful consequences of animal agriculture, I am feeling more inclined than ever to change my diet. I did not realize just how big of an impact I made on the environment by consuming red meat and it makes me sick to know that these big companies are hiding the real facts in an attempt to gain more money. In their own selfishness, they are wreaking havoc on our planet and making the climate crisis truly an impossible fight to win.
<br><br>
Kip's bravery to reveal all of the real facts to the public in this documentary truly inspires me and I hope that more people will watch Cowspiracy. It is truly shocking the effects that animal agriculture has on deforestation, rainforest destruction, greenhouse gases, etc and the truth behind these cattle industries needs to be revealed.

After watching "Cowspiracy" I too began to question my dietary choices. Throughout this whole class, I have learned that my diet can really make a difference, but this documentary really stood out to me. I feel terrible that these people are hiding real facts and evidence from everyday consumers just to ensure that they make money. It really makes me wonder when or even if people who run these large companies will one day realize that the consequences of what they are doing outweigh the money the have in their pockets. I agree that it seems as if the climate crisis is truly an impossible fight to win with all of the greed we have in our world. I really enjoyed Cowspiracy and will incline my family and friends to watch it.

<p>
After watching Cowspiracy I was definitely awakened to several impacts the food and meat industry has on our environment. Before this class, I had no idea how important just switching to a plant-based diet could be and how effective it is. It is even more efficient than some of the technological advances that Ken states in his video like wind turbines and solar panels. Coming from a family that eats a lot of meat, it really made me rethink my choices and after watching this video I was able to share what I had learned to my family to hopefully get them to reduce their meat consumption. 
<br><br>
Another point made in the lecture was that almost ⅓-¼ of the food that is produced gets wasted, which made me kind of angry because there are some people who are starving and so much food is being wasted that could have gone to them. The first thing that came to mind was the dining commons, I had a friend who worked there and shared with me that the food that does not get eaten is thrown away at the end of the day. It makes me mad because I know there are several college students who are struggling with food insecurity yet so much of the food they could have eaten gets wasted.

I really enjoyed the film “Wasted!” because it is super inspiring and thought provoking. It encourages people to think outside of the box when it comes to food and how we eat it. I really like the chefs that were featured in the film and how they are portrayed. They are presented as innovative, cool, and motivated. They are all trying to find new ways to turn food into art in environmental and ethical ways. 
<br><br>
They're main goal they are working towards is reducing waste. They see it not as an annoying problem, like the majority of grocery stores, but as a challenge they want to conquer. The chefs in the film mention the farm to table movement and also using food grocery stores throw out to make dishes in their restaurant. One restaurant in Italy uses food that the market throws away even though it is perfectly good food and makes their meals with it. Each day the menu changes because they never know what they will get. It is so fascinating and cool to me that a chef would be willing to change their menu everyday in order to reduce food waste. The film discusses so many ways to reduce food waste and all the pluses of these ways. There are no downsides to these innovations in the food industry.

Watching "Cowspiracy" really shocked me about how flawed our system fighting climate change really is. We've learned all quarter about how nobody is doing anything to help climate change and now to watch this was truly devastating. The fact that the organizations that claim that they are supporting the fight against climate change hold their only self-interested bias towards the issue is a real problem. Regular people who don't know much about climate change can be wrongly persuaded by these organizations into supporting the wrong cause. I believe this is one reason for the big misconception about climate change. Before this class, I too believed climate change was solely being caused by fossil fuels. I did not realize that the best way for us to combat climate change is our diet. Not to blame anyone because of their lack of information on the topic, but there are many people concerned about the burning of the amazon rainforest and such. However, these same people do not know the underlying cause of the fire, our own diets. These people have good intentions, but at the end of the day they return back to their daily diet which is truly the underlying reason for these fires. If we really care about the burnings of our world's rainforests, instead of focusing so much on protesting, we must kill the cause by its roots and consume less meat so that these farmers have no incentive to burn the forests down. I believe that a cultural change in our consumption is possible through much innovation creating plant based options of our most beloved food. This must happen as we see in Cowspiracy how devastating our ways of agriculture currently is to the rise in climate change.

Before I watched “Cowspiracy”, I remember a lot of my friends telling me about the documentary and how it significantly changed how they viewed the animal industry, and even convinced some of my friends to go vegan. When I heard about it, I initially thought that there was no way that that was possible; there was nothing that was convincing enough to switch my eating habits to veganism (unless it was life threatening). Fast forward to this week, where again, the documentary has managed to somehow enter my life. As I go through the film, I see the climate impacts it has. Although Ken debunks the idea that it is 51% of carbon emissions and is instead 15%, the fact that many of these companies, such as Oceana and the AAA, fail to either recognize these numbers or put aside the agricultural industry for different reasons is absolutely ridiculous. One person in the documentary likened the situation to an alcoholic of a father. The reason why a family’s relationship is strained is because of the father, but no one wants to talk about that, so they look to other reasons. The climate change crisis is no different. The agricultural business is too heavy into the pockets of politicians and is out of the minds of many climate change organizations. What Anderson has done is truly open our eyes to the political scheme that agriculture has created. 

<br><br>

But, for me, as a person who loves eating animal products, I was not ultimately convinced by the numbers or the deceit. People despise change to their diet, myself included. I did not see the translation to eating vegan food and helping to combat climate change. I concern myself with what was tangible to me, such as the Amazon Rainforest or the large climate disasters that we have seen these past years (as you mentioned). However, what I failed to see is that the animals that are being placed on my table for consumption are living, breathing creatures. When Andersen and his team visited the small duck farm, and saw the decapitation of the duck, I was appalled, How is this even allowed? Animals are creatures, and when we look at them as food, we fail to see that they are part of this planet as well. 

<br><br>

Today, I saw my dog for the first time this quarter. When I watched the movie, and saw him, I immediately thought about how I would feel if someone were to do that to my dog, Maxi. I just could not believe it. It was the first time that I ever thought about going vegan. Will I try to, maybe. But, Cowspiracy was the most compelling piece of footage I have ever seen about climate change.

After watching the film “Cowspiracy,” I find that the cow
industries are not only about the methane emission, but also about increased
carbon dioxide emissions, water depletion and nitrogen oxides, and so on. It leads
to lots of problems that I have never thought about. Before this, I thought the
most significant contributor is the fossil fuel industries or at least some big
factories, but I find that a big part of the greenhouse gases is from the agricultural
and livestock industry. I realized how emergency to change to a vegan-based diet,
to at least consume less and less meat and dairy.

I was also surprised by how much the beef industry contributes to climate change. While it was something that I had heard about, I never knew just how much it was impacting the environment. Also, it was interesting to see how changing to a plant-based diet could combat this.

Before I took this class, I never would have imagined that the methane released by livestock played such a huge rule in the climate crisis. Watching the documentary, Cowspiracy, only served to increase my shock as to how massive of a detrimental impact the beef industry has had on our planet. One of the most surprising facts was that the agribusiness is one of the (if not the) leading causes of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

<br><br>


Another surprising fact is one that Ken mentions in his video: that reducing food waste is more beneficial to the planet than switching to a largely plant based diet. I never really thought about food waste as being an actual global issue that could lead to this much environmental damage, but hearing Ken talk about some of the laws and regulations that states have (such as discarding entire egg cartons with only one damaged egg) definitely explains why it is such a big deal. As the Project Drawdown reading mentions, I definitely think that policy changes regarding these regulations, as well as interventions on the retailer and consumer level are necessary and could lead to huge reductions in emissions.

I watched the film “Cowspiracy” in high school in my environmental science class and the big picture of what Kip was trying to express has always stuck with me, but watching it this time made so many more things click together with all of the new information I learned. One scene that I will never forget and has scarred me especially when watching it for the second time was the scene with the man who had a duck “farm” in his house and killed the ducks on a table without a care in the world. He was so desensitized to this brutal action because he did it so many times from when he was a little boy, and even showed his kids how to kill the ducks in a technical form. Every little part of this film shows so many different issues with the livestock industry and animal agriculture in the world, but mainly the issues with it in the United States. One thing that I didn’t really remember from the first time I watched this film was how big the influence of fundraising is to environmental organizations which is why they lie to their audience by never mentioning the effects of animal agriculture on the environment. This made me so angry because these organizations should be focusing on making our world healthier and the environment a safer place so generations after us can live in a sustainable fashion. But instead, they are forced to hide the impact of the livestock industry because if they go against this influential industry they could lose money and potentially be categorized as terrorists by the FBI. Our own government supports the beef industry and hides the truth of where water is being used in the biggest amounts. I was shocked and frustrated when both the Chief in Sacramento and the leaders of the environmental organizations wouldn’t answer questions about the livestock industry or they would change the subject. 

<br><br>

Corporations are completely taking over our environment and government and most Americans can’t even see this happening. It is insane to me how people who should be helping promote the real issues regarding the environment are hiding the truth for a different agenda that is ruining our earth second by second. The people Kip interviewed that hid the truth showed us the truth by not being able to answer questions. One scene that impressed me was the man who worked for Greenpeace in the past and talked openly about the injustice and corruption in this organization when it comes to funding. These organizations are focusing on palm oil, fossil fuels, and different industries rather than the real issue which is animal agriculture and the immense US livestock industry. The family on the farm that raised livestock in a more “sustainable” way made me feel like that was a very good way to produce meat, but after Kip explained the numbers I felt brainwashed by the words of the family. It is so extremely dangerous how the real motive behind many Americans (corporations and environmental organizations) is profit rather than saving our earth.

I completely relate to how you feel about the scene with the man and his duck farm. In China, where many of my relatives live and who I visit often, this butchering of live animals is perfectly normal in many homes, yet in our society, it is seen as brutal and inhumane. As a kid, I remember watching my grandmother kill a rabbit from the market, and serve it to us for dinner the same night. Although I wasn't mentally scarred from the event, I have a friend who witnessed something similar and chose to go vegan after her experience. In reality, I believe what the livestock corporations are doing to produce meat and other goods are much worse than butchers. They raise and kill hundreds of thousands of animals --countless more than any individual butcher. I think the difference is that while butchers kill the animals with their own hands, corporations hide behind their brand image and name, selling tasty, large-portioned products, at the price of animal lives. Its unfair for butchers to be branded as heartless and inhumane while corporations are literally those exact things but to an infinitely greater extent.

Before watching this film, I had never heard of the term “obsessive-compulsive environmentalist” (OCE) before. However, I was confused when OCE was explained as only separating trash and recycling, composting, changing the lightbulbs, taking short showers, turning off the water when brushing your teeth, turning off the lights when leaving a room, essentially all these “obsessive” environmental things seemed very minimal, as if it did not have that much of an impact. 
 <br><br>
   Before, I never thought of how livestock plays a major role in global warming, but thanks to the film I see how it is and how it’s the leading cause of resource consumption and environmental degradation destroying the planet today. For instance, raising livestock only in the US consumes 34 trillion gallons of water, imagine how much bigger the number is when we take into account the whole world. It’s important to note raising animals for food consumes 1/3 of all the planet’s freshwater, occupies 45% of the planet’s land, responsible for 91% of amazon destruction, leading cause of species extinction, leading cause of ocean “dead zones,” and leading cause of habitat destruction. I never would have guessed that animal agriculture is the number 1 human cause of climate change, but after given credible statistics, there is no denying how damaging animal agriculture/livestock can be towards our planet. 
  <br><br>
  Our ocean’s ecosystem is being destroyed rapidly and I wonder if people are even aware. Because of our selfishness, we are causing 3/4ths of the world’s fisheries to be overexploited, fully exploited, or significantly depleted. What selfish act might it be this time? Overfishing. But our desire for fishing isn’t only harming the fishes, but the sharks as well. As many as 50 million sharks are killed each year from bi-kill, which is this idea that for every single pound of fish caught, there is up to 5 pounds of non targeted species trapped such as dolphins, whales, sea turtles, and sharks. 
<br><br>
Hearing the story about Dorothy Stang absolutely broke my heart. It completely disgusts and frightens me that someone could easily be executing their first amendment and it reveals that her life work was to protect the Amazon. It’s insane how she was brutally gunned down at point blank range by a hired gun from the cattle industry and it’s even more insane to think about the fact that her murder occured in 2005. These types of shady situations aren't all in the past and forgotten, it is in fact happening now as well.

I feel frustrated when I watch the film Cowspiracy, I personally like to have meat and dairy product, but learning from the film, the cow industry does not emit methane but also CO2 and many other things that do harm to our planet. One thing that I found very interesting is that some people choose to live a vegan lifestyle is because they think it is environmental friendly. I used to think that people choose to be vegans or vegetarians because they want to be healthier or they have a certain religion that requires them to do so. However, learning from Ken’s lecture and this film, and reading others’ comments, I notice that there are more reasons to be a vegan than I knew. It is not just about lifestyle or health, it is also about consistency of our planet.

What stood out to me most about "Cowspiracy" was the shocking incompetence (in regards to addressing agricultural production) of a lot of the organizations that claim to be “green.” For example, the representatives interviewed from Sierra Club and Oceana dodged questions about agricultural problems, subtly invalidated its significance (saying “Well, that’s your assessment. Our assessment is different”), and were reluctant to directly address the issue. These responses were infuriating to watch. The sheer unwillingness to even consider improving this issue also affected me on a personal level. I successfully cut beef and other cow products out of my diet for over a year now, and to be completely honest, it’s not that hard. After taking an environmental science course in high school last year and seeing how environmentally detrimental the agricultural industry is, I made the decision to stop eating red meat and decrease my overall meat consumption in general. After numerous attempts at convincing my family members to shift to a more plant-based diet with me, even meat-lovers like my dad have been changing their eating habits to become more environmentally conscious. Though not perfect, watching my family members choose turkey burgers over beef burgers after being educated on the issue is definitely a step in the right direction and makes me hopeful that other stubborn eaters can change their habits for the better as well. The fact that “eco-friendly” organizations wouldn’t even consider addressing the issue of agricultural production because it’s “too hard” is completely incorrect and just reflects their apathy towards a major problem. However, the documentary came out in 2014 and I think that since then, there has been a greater awareness of this issue that hopefully continues to influence people into changing their eating habits.

I completely agree- I was really upset to see that so many representative of iconic environmental organizations avoid the facts of the issues of animal agriculture. I found it really ironic that a lot of the people interviewed were labeled (or self-identified) as environmental experts, yet stated that discussing the negative impacts of an overuse of water, crops, and land (all easily understandable, basic things) due to animal agriculture was "out of their range of knowledge. It's not- these exact same issues are discussed regarding human overuse of water, over population leading to overuse/destruction of land, and wasting food; they just are afraid to talk about the issue of animal ag because of the rich and powerful that fun the ag industry. I find this disappointing, that these people who are supposed to be leaders of change and voices for the voiceless would blatantly avoid such a big issue out of fear of ag industry backlash. It's ironic because they speak out constantly against the big oil industry, the richest industry in the world- yet fear the animal ag industry? It's disappointing to say the least. 
  <br><br>
I also agree with you about cutting out red meat/meat products- it's really not that hard. I've been meatless for all of this school year while eating mostly from the dining halls and have been able to be really successful- if I can do it at a college dining hall, anyone can do it when they have free reign over what they choose to purchase and eat. Being environmentally aware and conscious isn't difficult, you just have to care enough to try.

Conspiracy was a very entertaining watch, and I was continually blown away by the stats presented on the agriculture side of the climate crisis. It's unfathomable to think about how destructive meat farming is. It's crazy to think about who we could potentially end world hunger if we stopped using grain and plants to feed cattle, but used it to feed people instead. However, Andersen's use of false statistics severely undermines his effort to express how severe this issue is. While "over 50%" sounds a lot more severe than a mere "15%", but if shown to the viewer that this statement isn't true, it loses all of Andersen's credibility. However, this slip and respective loss of credibility pales in comparison when put next to the loss of credibility organizations such as the Sierra Club and Ocean face after being exposed for their aversion of tackling one of the most pressing issues of the climate crisis.
  <br><br>

While the negative effect that the meat industry has on our climate is shocking and horrible, I was equally appalled at the "green" companies for their lack of addressing such a significant issue. While attacking the meat industry can be a dangerous thing for a green organization to do, as it can lose many supporters to lose interest in their cause as they feel attacked by being told to switch their diet, and it can also lead the meat industry to attack back. This could lead to a loss of funding for these organizations, which is not in their best interest. However, to completely ignore the topic is extremely irresponsible on their end.

While watching “Cowspiracy”, I also found it particularly interesting how environmental companies like Greenpeace and Oceana were reluctant to comment on the factor that animal agriculture plays in climate change. Greenpeace’s refusal to participate in the film truly made me more intrigued regarding the issue of animal agriculture. During almost every interview that the narrator conducted, when the question about the meat industry arose, there was always a faint look of panic and uncomfortableness that immediately surfaced in whoever was being interviewed. This alone makes it seem that there’s a lot going on behind the scenes of the meat industry that they never want the public to know. To me, this was upsetting to think that major so-called “environmentalist” companies were somehow being forced to not talk about an industry that’s responsible for 15% of global greenhouse emissions and is the leading cause of ocean dead zones, habitat destruction, and species extinction. Being such a major player in climate change and environmental disturbance, how could these companies not have anything to say? 

  <br><br>

This film was just as eyeopening about the meat industry as “Blackfish” was about the fishing industry. Learning about all the harm that is done to our environment and the thousands of species affected, I was in disbelief. This documentary easily convinced me about the magnitude of this issue and the importance of a cultural shift in eating habits. Many people say that they want to change more habits in their life that will help the planet but refuse to take the simple step of eating less meat or even completely cutting meat out of their diet. The fact that raising livestock produces more emissions than the entire transportation sector, including cars, buses, trains, planes, trucks, and subways, should help people understand how big a difference cutting out meat can make. Livestock is notorious for being one of the largest contributors, along with fracking, to methane emissions. While methane doesn’t have as long of an atmospheric lifespan as carbon dioxide, which is currently the highest stressed greenhouse gas, it is nearly 34 times more powerful at increasing temperatures and propelling climate change. In order to effectively and quickly make any changes that will help save our planet from complete environmental destruction, we must, as a society, consider significantly decreasing our meat consumption. This is why I think it’s vital that groups like Greenpeace or WWF begin talking about and exposing the animal agriculture industry and start forcing them to take responsibility for the destruction they’re causing.

I felt the same way while watching “Cowspiracy.” I couldn’t believe that organizations that everyone looks up to as being top environmental stewards could turn a blind eye to the detrimental effects of agriculture on the environment. The maker of the documentary explained that these groups don’t focus on the issue of agriculture because they believe if they do so they’ll lose donors. I find this disgusting. Organizations like Amazon Watch, Oceana, and Greenpeace are supposed to be fighting against companies who are contributing to the climate crisis but they are instead behaving like these companies. They are ignoring important issues for monetary gain. One of the most shocking scenes of this documentary was when he was interviewing someone from Amazon Watch. Their mission is to fight against the destruction of the Amazon but she would only admit that agriculture accounts for 91% of this destruction after being asked multiple times. The fact that she kept avoiding the issue shows that she knew the detrimental affects of agriculture all along but was trying to hide it because of the company’s focus on other issues.

It was quite interesting to see how  the people who claim to be part of the environmental movement were quiet when presented upon the pressing issue that is one of the leading causes of climate change. I, too, was pressed to see how they significantly devalued its significance simply because they want to continue receiving money for issues they don't actually care about. For example, when they finally got the interview with the women who kept saying, "I don't think I feel comfortable answering that", it left me really annoyed at how higher corporations only say they are on the side of sustainability when it benefits them financially. Most big environmentally conscious organizations, such as WWF or Greenpeace, all paint this picture that they actually do care and are focusing on the most pressing issues regarding saving the planet. WWF is a big one that comes into mind for me. I remember being younger and seeing commercials about how pandas are going extinct due to our human actions and just for a mere $5 a month, we can help save them from extinction. After seeing this documentary, my mind was all wrong. Was something I have believed in since I was younger a lie? And of course, like most corporations, it was. It is all about money and always will be. As long as we continue to favor money over the death of our planet, we will be gone before we know it. And so will the pandas!

I also found the responses by the many of the people featured in Cowspiracy to be highly frustrating. If I am perfectly honest, before watching the film and taking this class, I was highly unaware of the effects eating meat had on the environment. I believe it is because it is not being widely publicized due to the huge amount of control the beef industry has. That makes me very frustrated, as there are probably many people who would at least attempt to cut down the meat in their diet if they knew of the detrimental effects it had on our environment. I found it even more shocking that even representatives of supposedly environmental groups refused to talk about the meat industry and its negative effect on the planet. I found such a reaction highly irresponsible. 
  <br><br>
 After learning about the effects of the meat industry on the planet, I have been trying to make better choices in what I eat. I am a very big meat lover, so giving up meat is not something I can do immediately. Even so, I am willing to try as I know it is bad for the environment. I’m sure there are people who think similarly, but they need to be educated and understand the effects the meat industry has on our planet. Being informed is the first step to taking action. With big representatives covering up the truth, that might be impossible. Of course, as you mentioned, this was filmed in 2014 and a lot has changed since then. I feel like a lot of people these days are much more informed, which gives me hope that we are heading in the right direction.

I agree one of the most interesting parts of the film wash how major environmental corporations denied or altogether failed to mention how much on an impact that the dairy industry is having on climate change and CO2 emission. When I was watching this it just made me angry. I did not understand how people that seemed so invested in the environmental movement could deny, and fail to comment on such a major contribution to the emissions. It wasn’t until later on in the film when I realized the reasoning behind why they were not talking about the issue. It is because such huge meat and dairy producers have such a huge stock on the government and what happens. They have so much control over people and companies that even the environmental movement and programs are scared that they will harm their career and jobs that they push the issue away. What really shocked me was that the FBI said that the number one contributor to domestic terrorism was environmentalists and animal rights activists. This makes so sense to me. The people that want to help people and the environment the most are viewed in the eyes as the FBI as the most threatening!? To me this is wrong. As Ken pointed out he can’t live in fear of his own life and job and future when thousands of animal’s livelihoods are being taken away due to the industry. We must stand up and act against. It. 
     <br><br>
     I liked how you have been trying to get your family to eat less red meat and switching to a plant based diet. I have been doing the same thing. Similar to you it is hard to encourage people, especially meat lovers to give up something that they love. But I have found that over time if you keep pushing the idea and encouraging it then overtime people might start to see the benefits. In the film something that stood out to me that I wasn’t a fan of was how a it was stated that going meatless on Mondays was not really helping that much. To me I disagree. I think that any act toward limiting meat intake can help. It make an individual realize that they do not need meat to survive and thrive. When meat is eliminated one day it is easier for the next days to follow, and cutting meat out one day a week soon turns into 3 days a week and the next thing you know meat has been totally eliminated from your diet. 
     <br><br>
      One last thing that I found really effective in the film was the use of images and statistics. Maybe to me those things stand out more than others but seeing the amounts of water used in graphs and numbers and comparisons really made the impact of how many resources were being used stronger. As a vegetarian I believe that we all can start to pull our part and make steps everyday to eating a more plant based diet.

I was also shocked when watching the organizations completely go around his questions or not even bother to answer them. The fact that many of them were either completely ignorant to the issue or knew about it and just decided not to comment just goes to show how little people are doing about this issue. In my junior year of high school, my English teacher had us watch Food Inc. (which is a very good documentary and would highly recommend). This documentary showed the horrifying side of the meat industry. Directly after viewing it I had also cut out all beef and cow products and have also not found it to be as difficult as people have made it out to be. It has been now well over two years for me now and don’t plan on ever going back to eating chicken or cow products. Growing up in a very American household, I grew up eating hot dogs, hamburgers, and many other meat products (if you go to Google images and search up “American foods” almost all of them contain meat). When I made the choice to go pescatarian, meaning I still eat seafood just no other meat products, I actually got a bit of criticism from my family. My mom complained about how it would be more difficult for her to make meals and my cousins asked why I would give up such delicious foods. However, my mom eventually came around to it and tries to eat a more plant-based diet. Let’s hope that more people will make these changes as people become more informed about the industry.

I completely agree with your opinion. The entire time I was watching the documentary I couldn’t help but continuously think about how these companies who spread green messages are really manipulating the public in order to drive their fundraising at a high. When representatives from each of their respective companies was questioned regarding the agricultural and beef sector as they relate to greenhouse gas emissions, they all backed away or quicky refuted the claims because they don’t want to address a problem that is so close and dear to a lot of people in the United States; for a lot of them, it would be impossible for them to switch off a beef diet and as an effect those companies would lose those peoples’ support if they told them they needed to quit that lifestyle in order to save the planet. No one wants to change that. However, I think that if companies were to promote small steps that would help this problem it could be very effective; for example, maybe starting people off to not eat meat one day out of the week and then more and more days as they progress and get accustomed to plant-based diets.

I agree, I found one of the most shocking parts of the film to be the sheer denial of the agricultural industry's impact on the environment by widely recognized "green" organizations. Many of these organizations simply chose to ignore the major effects the agricultural industry had.I found their monetary influence on these organizations to be the most frustrating because it completely undermined their mission to fight environmental harms. Moreover the beef industry's influence has expanded way beyond that of just environmental organizations but has also become entangled with politics and our own government. It sometimes feels as though it's impossible to trust an establishment not influenced by big money companies. Although I had seen this documentary a couple years ago, rewatching this film reminded me of all the reasons I had decided to give up beef and made me think of the ease with which I was able to do it. Not only have the selection of beef alternatives become more widely available as of today but also more popular. I also agree that since this documentary came out a greater consciousness now exists of just how damaging and unsustainable our agricultural sector has become. Just as Ken mentioned, I do think that some of the film's credibility is undermined by their use of exaggerated facts however they were successful in getting the point across that ultimately the beef industry does account for a substantial amount of emissions. While I don't support the use of their exaggerated facts, I do think it was important for them to stress the urgency of the issue.

The surprising amount contradictory organizations and companies that claim to be "green" was definitely, well.. disappointing. Some of the arguments that various advocates or scientist in the film say that the reason these organizations don't want to speak up, was because they didn't want to challenge peoples "ideal" or that they might loose funding from supporting a controversial issue. But isn't the point of these "climate advocates"--such as Sierra Club and Oceana--to show people the bad things we are doing for the climate, the ugly truth, even if they conflict with our personal lives? To be honest, I doubt most people would be happy to reduce the amount of meat they in their diet ( I sure wasn't), but the point of me incorporating plant based in my life was to help the environment. And this is what it should boil down to, things that help the environment, regardless if its for yourself (which need i remind you that this is a global issue, therefore your issue !). If these organizations put self funding and interest first while climate issues are second, they become almost comparable to those companies/educators who are anti-climate change and prioritize money. They don't want whats best for the environment, they want whats best for their wallets!

Your comment gives me hope that our generation can make the proper decisions to save our planet. I too eat a completely plant based diet. It is great to hear that you are doing your best to spread the message of the plant based diet. As the film demonstrated, the meat and dairy business is absolutely horrible for the environment. This is known and the statistics are through the roof about how much a plant based diet can help the carbon footprint of every human.  As I also began my journey to try to convince my family and friends on the vegetarian diet there are also many other benefits. It is much better for your health than a meat diet. Films such as GameChangers demonstrate how people with a plant based diet are overall MUCH more healthy than meat eaters. Not only is it super good for you, It also directly saves the lives on innocent animals. Thank you for making a change to your actions. Keep it up!

I too was appalled by the companies’ reluctance to notice their problems with agribusiness. The fact that they knowingly represent their company as “green” when, in reality, it is the opposite, is the product of corrupt businesses out to only make more money. They do not care about the people they are deceiving and “Cowspiracy '' exposes these companies for all their wrongdoings. 
     <br><br>


I can sympathize with your family as I too have been trying to cut back on the amount of beef I consume. At this point, I have already learned a lot about the industry and the damage it causes, but for some reason, I still find myself consuming it. Recently, I have tried to lower my consumption to once or twice a week, which has been the best method for me (instead of completely cutting it out of my life). This film did add to the reasons why I should completely stop, so I hope that I can follow through and truly take myself away from this harmful agricultural industry.



<br><hr>

That was also what stood out to me the most while watching "Cowspiracy". How could the biggest environmental organizations in the world not even mention the problems of the agricultural industry? The fact that they just flat out avoid talking to Anderson or stutter and hesitate while trying to quickly change the subject just seems really suspicious. It didn't add up, but it finally made sense when Anderson showed how journalists and other environmentalists who spoke up about the meat industry were actually getting murdered by people from the industry. It's so scary that these people resort to MURDER just to prevent their businesses from becoming less profitable. The value that is put onto wealth is ridiculous. No wonder everyone is scared to even talk about it because money-hungry people who live off of slaughtering meat and ruining the planet will literally put a bullet in their head. We need to get these people out of a position of power, somehow. Hopefully a cultural change in our diets that are sustainable and plant-based will begin to help.



<br><hr>

Seeing these organizations dodging the questions made me question the integrity of their organization. A point mentioned in the film was that these organizations don't want to mention certain impactful ways to avoid the emissions of climate change simply because they wouldn't receive funds anymore because they'd be promoting change of people's habits, eating meat. I personally know a friend who, after watching "Cowspiracy," changed their diet to strictly plant-based. The impact that this documentary had on a friend of mine, made me reconsider what I'm eating. While I do not think that I can go on a strictly plant-based diet, I do want to decrease my habit of eating meat, especially cow meat since it greatly impacts our environment.



<br><hr>

I agree with you that it really isn't as hard as many people think to switch to a plant based diet. This movie brought up numerous times how daunting it seems to get a lot of people to transition away from reliance on meat and dairy, and I think one of the main reasons this a big concern (besides for propaganda from the beef industry) is cultural attachment. I know that in my family, my dad is attached to family traditions of cooking and German/spanish cuisine, to the point that going vegan would almost seem like a betrayal to his personality. That's a little extreme, but I think that a lot of people are attached to the foods they eat just as they are attached to the clothes they wear and the ways they express themselves... 
     <br><br>

At least that is how I used to feel. I came home from school this weekend and I noticed that my entire family was buying primarily vegan products and meat was no longer the main dish every night; in fact often there was no meat on the table at all. My sisters have always been vegetarian, but the conversion of both of their boyfriends, my mom, me, and now almost my dad as well is really encouraging. I think people just need to be reminded that they can make a positive impact so easily simply by not contributing to one of the most harmful aspects of global warming. 
     <br><br>

On a separate note, I also found the denial of the beef's industry carbon footprint from supposedly green organizations extremely upsetting. It made me realize that we may not always be getting the most reliable information about the state of our planet, and we always need to make sure the companies and organizations we put trust into do not have ulterior motives.



<br><hr>

I certainly have the same disappointing feeling as you have for those organizations. It is even more horrible to see that they actually cover the meat industry based on personal interests and it is sad to see that no one is able to challenge them ever. As Ken' describes that a plant-based diet would contribute to solving the issue partly, I would like to quote from Dr. Richard Oppenlander in the film who says that "only one day of being a vegan is not enough to change a person’s whole perception and is not going to help save the world, but it will be good to pursue a seven-day vegan diet." This makes sense when the climate crisis is such an urgent issue now. But I also believe that we should keep in mind that a revolutionary cultural change has to occur, especially for the idea of food waste. It is convincing to pursue a plant-based diet but it is certainly more compelling to not waste the food. I think it will be great if we have more organizations that spread out this notion instead of those irresponsible ones who conspire with the beef industry. A cultural change is the starting point of solving the climate problem and it will become more powerful ever since we have one step further on our notion of food.

I completely agree with your take on how it was infuriating watching representatives from these big environmental groups completely dodge questions about the agricultural industry. It is sad to say that the beef industry has taken over our food industry in the United States and there is not enough education about how detrimental it is for the environment and your health. It is as if these major environmental groups are scared to speak up, in fear that the beef industry will come after them because of how much impact they have on the United States economy. It does not help that there has been 1110 environmental activists who have spoken up about the agricultural industry and have been killed in Brazil in the past 20 years. Documentaries like "Cowspiracy '' and "What the Health?" should be used as tools to educate the public about the beef industry. Eating meat has been so ingrained in our culture, that people are fearful of what would happen if it was cut out of our diets. Like you said, making the switch to a plant based diet is not the hardest part of this problem. Instead, educating and convincing a society that is so consumed in eating meat to switch their diets is definitely the most difficult part of this problem. We need documentaries like “Cowspiracy” and social media to spread the message about how animal production plays the biggest role in the climate crisis (approximately 51%).



<br><hr>

 this was also one of the most frustrating things about the documentary to me. Anderson interviewed a variety of businesses in the meat industry, but none of them were willing to admit to their negative environmental impact. Like you, I also noticed how even corporations claiming to be “environmentally friendly” continuously dodged questions that questioned this claim. You can’t both be in the meat industry and claim to be environmentally progressive. The two things just don’t go hand in hand. After seeing this film I have officially decided to switch away from the meat industry. Throughout this class, I have known this is the biggest thing I can do right now to reduce my carbon footprint and have played with the idea in my mind. But now I want to start. I can’t consider myself both an advocate for the environment and eat as much meat as I do. Hopefully, by the end of this month, I can go full vegetarian. In addition, watching the different scenes were the gruesome slaughter of the animals took place was moving. It forces the audience to reflect on what they are doing when they eat meat. In addition to reducing meat consumption, Ken comments on how we also need to reduce food waste. In addition to your point on food industries neglecting their environmental impact, they also ignore the waste they produce, taking no responsibility for it and its impact on the environment. On an individual level, I never waste food, I always eat what’s on my plate whether I love it or hate it. However, our system doesn’t have the same attitude, and tons of food is wasted before it ever reaches individuals. According to Ken, reducing waste and eating a largely plant-based diet could result in the reduction of 137 gigatons of CO2 gases per year. This leads to Ken’s point about the filmmakers messing up their facts about the percentage impact of food waste on CO2 emissions. Although this does weaken their point, as it is a distraction from the overall argument that can be easily attacked by climate deniers, their point is still strong. The ideas produced in the film, and the points made about the meat industry and food waste, are all something we should keep in mind when we choose what and how we eat in the future.

I agree that in the film the companies were completely ignoring the issue of animal agriculture because every time he would clearly make a point for her to say what the leading cause is she completely started rambling about topics to divert the topic and she would make a point about other causes instead of the obvious leading cause and say that these are all leading causes.  However, from the numbers in the movie, they clearly show that animal agriculture is by far the leading cause.  I also wanted to bring up how in the film they were talking about environmentalist are not practicing what they preach by not being vegan.  However, I think an environmentalist could be what it is today, but their definition to be vegan is hard for some.  I think anyone that shows concern about the environment should be an environmentalist no matter how much they can commit to it.  For me, I find it hard to be a vegan before this class I knew eating meat was bad and that is killing animals and as I grew older I gained knowledge that it affects the climate badly too.  Although I want to help against eating meat and start a vegan lifestyle it is hard for me because I like meat so much. ( I mean I'm eating a chicken bowl from Hana's Kitchen right now)



<br><hr>
Yes, I strongly agree that the most frustrating part of this film was watching the interviews that Kip Anderson does (and does not) hold with representatives from these large environmental groups. Their ignorance on the severity of the issue of agricultural production exemplifies the reality that considering all the contributors to the climate crisis is essential, and, while most of the interviewees acknowledges that there are many forces driving the negative impacts of anthropogenic climate change, none of them were particularly knowledgeable on agriculture and livestock production. It also seems to always come down to the issue of money and profit, just as authors Michael Pollan and Dr. Will Tuttle note. Regardless of the messages these organizations stand for, if they refuse to address a key environmental issue such as agriculture, they are ultimately refusing to stand for a change in today’s typical American lifestyle. And this problem we see with environmental groups completely goes back to what Ken speaks about in his lecture for Cowspiracy and his main lecture for this week, in which he emphasizes the need for a complete shift in cultural values regarding food production and waste. Those who claim the title “environmentalists” should not only advocate for more sustainable actions but also reduce their own carbon footprint through the small, individual choices they make on a daily basis.

Hi, I too was shocked at how companies and organizations dodged the topic of animal agriculture and its problems after watching Cowspiracy. I noticed that many people became silent/speechless or refused to comment when learning about the harmful effects of animal agriculture. At one point in the film, they asked a woman if those in power within the animal agriculture community was funding Oceana and companies like that. The fact that she refused to comment on it made things very sus. I started questioning all the other organizations and wondered if they were supported by those in that community.
     <br><br>
Once Kip started worrying about his safety after hearing how activists get killed or people who look too deep into it makes me shiver. The amount of power the meat industry has is insane. I'm glad Kip and his colleagues decided to pursue the rest of this film because it did make me so much more aware of what I'm consuming and has convinced me to turn towards an all plant-based diet. This film exposed the animal agriculture industry and its carbon footprint and its overwhelming power. 
     <br><br>
I do agree when they say that you cannot be an environmentalist and consume meat as well. You must practice what you preach or else, you're simply a hypocrite. I wouldn't consider myself a complete environmentalist but I do hope my switch to a plant-based diet will slowly help this world grow instead of dying. I have already started recommending this video to my peers and family with the hopes of educating them on the meat industry and how plant-based diets can potentially save us from this disastrous situation.




<br><hr>

I was also shocked by many aspects of "Cowspiracy." This film showed me just how problematic the meat industry can be. I also didn't understand why so-called "green" organizations were unwilling to address so many important issues. Oftentimes, companies like this rely on ignorance from their consumers. Unfortunately, many consumers will continue to remain ignorant, oftentimes by choice. This will inevitably lead to these problems in our society growing up until we will be unable to stop them.



<br><hr>
I agree with you that it was shocking how organizations could claim to be green yet not want to deal with the subject. Their avoidance of factory farming and animal agriculure just furthers how desire for money and power can cause people to not care about the environment. If the organizations aren't going to care, then the people must care. A major way the people can show they care is through being a conscious consumer and avoiding meat. I love how you talk about how your family is slowly converting to being more plant based. Any step, no matter how small, is still a step. Switching over to the documentary Wasted,  I was shocked to learn that 40% of the food we produce goes to waste. We have a hunger problem happening in America and so it breaks my heart knowing that we have enough food to provide for these people, yet we do nothing to help them. It was so inspiring seeing how Daily Table is a company that’s actually trying to do something about it by providing poor people access to healthy, inexpensive food. Over 90% of the wasted food ends up in landfills. When wasted food ends up in landfills, it can’t properly decompose, so large sums of methane gas end up in our atmosphere. Through composting, feeding people, and feeding livestock, we have the power to reduce food waste and thus reduce the amount of greenhouse gases entering our atmosphere.  I am especially inspired by the freegan movement and want to give it a try.




<br><hr>

I completely agree with your statement. The inaction from organizations deeply angered me. I understand why they did it, it was to not confuse the public and to keep them focused on one issue at a time. Unfortunately, with the magnitude of the crisis, this is no longer a luxury we can take. Seeing those organizations react like that just made me feel like they were untrustworthy or that they had ulterior motives.
     <br><br>

Even though I love meat and I definitely consume more than the average American for protein reasons, I have been trying to cut down on my beef intake after watching Cowspiracy. Like you said, it really isn’t that hard. At the beginning it may be a little annoying to forgo beef or skip meat for a meal but if it helps stop the world from bursting into flames, it honestly shouldn’t be that big of an issue. I hope to follow in your footsteps and continue to reduce my meat consumption.



<br><hr>

I agree, it's so infuriating watching these companies that are seen as environmental leaders dodge questions about one of the largest environmental concerns. As we have been learning, the way we eat is one of the largest ways we can reduce our emissions at a personal level. For "green" organizations to not be openly promoting reducing beef consumption seems hypocritical. How can they preach sustainability without addressing a huge unsustainable part of our society. Similarly I found it very shocking how corrupt the food industry is. Not only is this industry disastrous for the environment but also it is run by the monopoly of Monsanto. A single company is able to control the agricultural business while simultaneously destroying the environment. This once again proves that we are in serious need of a complete reconstruction of our current society. 
     <br><br>
Just like you cut out red meat, I became vegetarian a couple of years ago. I don't find it too difficult to eat a largely plant-based diet. However I received help from my family who joined me in cutting out meat products, for the most part. I can understand why it may be difficult for people to eat largely plant-based if they live at home. Yet choosing to reduce your meat consumption in any way is very important.



<br><hr>

I couldn’t agree more. It was concerning and disheartening to see trademarked, highly influential, and widely-respected organizations bypassing their commitments and responsibility to “green” operations with the environment. It’s shameful that companies/organizations with so much capability and capacity sit in silence when questioned and inquired about animal agriculture and production, which is understood by most, if not all of the environmentally aware/involved, to be one of the leading contributors to the climate crisis. It was interesting to see the function, dynamic, and influence of financial donors in the documentary. As the filmmaker discussed, the main reason why these representatives were silenced and afraid to further discuss certain topics is because of the influence and agenda of donors and primary financial supporters. This interplay and dynamic completely undermines each company’s mission, commitment, and responsibility to combat the environmental (climate) crisis. Not a single organization stood up to recognize the true nature of their operations in the beef/cow and livestock industry and its detriment to the environment. 
     <br><br>

I feel like this documentary was especially effective in communicating its message to its meat-loving audience. There is a plethora of data, statistics, alongside the compelling interviews that display the magnitude of the overarching problem within this area and industry that billions of us partake in. As a constituent meat eater myself, I believe its efforts and experiences like these that will encourage the most awareness and activism involving this issue. It is of utmost important to effectively translate the true magnitude of impacts that this industry continues to employ on our environment.



<br><hr>
I agree it was shocking how little conservation organizations knew about how the agricultural sector is causing so much damage to the planet  and how big organizations are denying it. I think that the people or organizations that do know are afraid of the retaliation big food industries may take if they try to bring out the issue into the light. After all big food industries hold so much power and influence.




<br><hr>

I was also really confused when the representatives of the "green" organizations Kip met with didn't seem to know anything about the effects of the livestock industry on the environment. Considering their careers are based on studying and understanding the environment and climate change, it seemed odd to me how they either didn't know anything about this issue, or just didn't want to speak on it - maybe for career reasons or relationships with those involved in the livestock industry or policy makers or something? Either way, it was disappointing to see that kind of disregard.
     <br><br>

I think it's really admirable how you've personally cut beef and cow products out of your diet, and how you've tried to involve your family, as well. A lot of people in my family, like my dad, and other members of the extended family, are definitely so called "stubborn" eaters, as you mentioned. It would be less likely for them to want to cut meat out of their diet, but like you said, it can start with small changes, like turkey burgers. I think a lot of the older generation is definitely more reluctant than the younger generation to reduce their meat consumption. However, I think the more our culture shifts towards plant-based eating, and the more people are exposed to information and documentaries like this one, there is definitely hope for progress to be made, in shifting the world off of meat and towards plant-based diets.



<br><hr>

I completely agree with you that the incompetence of organizations really is truly appalling. It’s crazy, as well as heartbreaking, to think how many companies are “environmentally friendly” but with ulterior motives. They operate under the facade of being good and green and kind when they really aren’t, which is almost worse than just being blatant about the impact of their actions. I hope that one day organizations view the issues with agricultural production as a fun challenge rather than “too hard” of a problem to solve, especially given the significance of the issue.
     <br><br>
I also wanted to applaud you for not only being able to cut beef out of your diet, but also for encouraging your family to do so as well. While I see a lot of people in our generation choosing to change their diets, it’s not nearly as common in older generations, and it is so nice to see that there are some who are making changes for the better. Small steps like that can make all the difference when a large number of people act, and the only way they will be able to take action is if they are aware of the importance. 
     <br><br>
As to address Ken’s question which he brought up in his lecture video, I think that Anderson’s use of incorrect facts hurts his credibility. By skewing the statistic so drastically (from 15% to 50%) he may cause people to disregard his entire documentary completely as they could likely believe that it wasn’t just one or two things that were misrepresented, but everything, and continue about their non-eco-friendly ways, completely unaware of the impact they are having. While I do appreciate documentaries, because of misrepresented and misreported statistics, I don’t see them as having a huge impact on the people that watch them. As a result, I think one of the most important things we can do to help put an end to the climate crisis is to spread awareness and establish credibility, which means not ever skewing numbers, even if it could “help” by making the situation seen worse than it is.

My mom saw this film three years ago and tried over and over to get me to watch it. The problem (back then at least) was that while she LOVED documentaries, I completely loathed them - so naturally I didn't watch it. I remember she used to rave on and on about how good this documentary was and how crazy it was that so many corporations and businesses are not being honest about animal agriculture and the impacts it has. And then she went vegetarian. In my household, my mom going vegetarian meant that we all had to go vegetarian because while we all pitch in to cook - we can only do so with the groceries she buys. I was completely destroyed. I remember being so hung up on how she could have the guts to  "torture" us; because I believed that any food without meat was too bland. Six months later, I would have been able to tell you how overly dramatic I was being in the beginning, and how since then not only did I know (based off my moms accounts) that I was partaking in some revolution of better eating to help the environment, but I also felt better too. I have been an on again-off again vegetarian. My point being that like you, I have found that converting my diet to one that contains little to no meat was not as hard as my once extreme carnivorous self might have predicted. I'm glad I finally got around to give this documentary a chance - to see and hear for myself the hype that my mom had made it out to be some time ago. I found this film to be quite complex. I agreed with Kip's overall message of trying to make animal agriculture and simple change of diet that introduces less if not no meat consumption, but was too quite baffled at the responses of many of these organizations. It specifically shocked me to see that the president of Clover - Stornetta Dairy, Marcus Bendetti believed and stated that dairy was not sustainable for humans but many world protection organizations could not even admit that animal agriculture was a main factor in climate change. What frustrated me even further was how many of the representatives Kip interviewed seemed to chuckle or laugh at his probing questions of the importance of factory farming and animal agriculture being an issue, seeming as if they were in a way dismissing him and his questions. I was quite shocked to also learn that grass-fed farming is much more unsustainable than factory farming- given that whenever "grass-fed" is mentioned, it is always in context of supposed to be better for the environment.




<br><hr>

To see organizations that are supposed to be trust-worthy and wise on environmental issues turn around and not make any comment on animal agriculture is incredibly infuriating. Organizations like the Sierra Club and Oceana are supposed to be guiding lights for people to look to in this crisis, yet they're just as corrupt as a politician that is funded through fossil fuels. While Kip's numbers are off (I found it a little hard to believe that animal agriculture contributed to 51% of greenhouse gas emissions, and Ken confirmed my suspicions) he still raises awareness on a major contributor to greenhouse gases, and a contributor that no one is talking about. Since the documentary was made in 2014 I can only hope that more people/organizations realize what animal agriculture is doing to our environment, and how our selfish want for a steak dinner every night is speeding up our planet's rapid decline.
     <br><br>
Kip Anderson created another documentary, "What the Health", in 2017, talking about the health benefits that come with a plant-based diet. Although that film covered animal cruelty and personal health rather than environmental implications, "What the Health" inspired me to eat a pescatarian/vegetarian diet. I had countless family members ask if it was difficult or if I missed eating meat, but I honestly don't even think about eating meat anymore and completely block it out of my mind at the dining halls on campus, or anywhere else. My hope is that thousands of other people will see a film or a piece of media that inspires them to do the same. Otherwise, there are only going to be more problems with our planet as time creeps on.




<br><hr>

I agree with what you had to say. I found it very annoying to see how big organizations who claim to be climate activists and are considered to be leading experts on the situation of the crisis, were not able to comment on any questions related to animal agriculture. They had no problem talking about other areas like the fossil fuel industry, but once he started asking about animal agriculture they kept blowing him off. This made me question how reliable these climate organizations really are. I was confused in the scene where they were saying that in order to help fish we had to eat fish? Like how does that work? Though this film has its flaws, such as the over exaggeration in the statistics, it is still very effective in getting its message across. This film shows how big of an impact animal agriculture has on our environment and opens our eyes to the fact that we have to change the way we eat and fast. It doesn’t have to be as drastic as Ken said. We don’t need to switch entirely to a plant-based diet. We need to stop wasting the food that we already have.

The effectiveness of "Cowspiracy" comes from its use of data that helps put into perspective how damaging the meat industry is to the climate. By showing how a single hamburger requires 600 gallons to produce helps reach an understanding with the audience. I'm sure that many Americans see a simple hamburger as a regular thing; the fact that so much resources go into making something so common and mass produced really puts into perspective how much the meat industry affects climate change.
     <br><br>
It is also shocking to find out that a lot of activists speaking out against this were killed. It is almost like a conspiracy, but proven true. The extent of the meat industry's greed can be seen by how they would go as far as murder those that are trying to spread awareness in order to preserve their profits

Honestly I had a hard time getting passed the fact that the crux of his argument was based on inaccurate information. Sure, the message is still good, and the call to action is still necessary, but knowingly including a drastically incorrect statistic seems almost lazy I guess? Furthermore I think it really decreased the effectiveness of the film. When we read about the Heartland Institute, we briefly looked at how they would do whatever they could to tear down the credibility of authors who created media about climate change, and Kip practically handed them the chance to attack his credibility, and, in doing so, undermine the legitimacy of his overall claim.

After watching the film, "Cowspiracy", I was surprised how much food waste there really is and how much change a plant-based diet can make. Honestly, the change to a largely plant-based diet is probably one of the hardest changes for me. I can fly less, move to a city so I'm not dependent on a car, consume/buy less, but to change my diet in this way is hard. I consider myself a "foodie", as in I take pictures of my food pretty frequently, and I'll go out of my way to eat good food. While a plant-based diet can certainly be very tasty, it feels like too many of the foods I love to eat fall in the category of meat and dairy; I probably eat eggs everyday. Giving up Korean barbecue? I'm not sure if I can. Even after watching the film, I have to think hard whether a largely plant-based diet is something I actually want to adopt.
     <br><br>

It's pretty crazy how much methane cows emit. Actually, it's even more crazy just how many cows we have. Cowspiracy puts it into perspective how big of a problem our meat industry is currently. So much food is produced only to be wasted.

In the film, I was super surprised to hear that it takes at least 25 years for vegetables to decompose. My whole life, I always thought that the consequences for throwing away vegetables and fruit was little to nothing, thinking that they were always composted or that they easily/quickly decompose. However, its very unsuspecting that it takes decades for this process to happen , and even when it does, the landfills create an abundance of methane in the process. Now, I will always think of the repercussions of aimlessly throwing away vegetables/fruit, as they surprisingly cause much more harm than anticipated.

When I think about how many organizations that dedicate themselves to climate change actually ignore the agricultural industry, it makes me absolutely furious. There are so many “innovative solutions” that go into climate change solving, such as…. catching more fish. HOW INNOVATIVE IS THAT! Wow that just sounds like the most swell idea I have ever heard. 

     <br><br>

When the representative of Oceana said that as long as they don’t hit the main source, then fish can be a great source of food. Yet, when actual fish farmers talked about “sustainable fish farming”, they said that term is an absolute hoax; it does not exist. It makes people feel better about what they are doing, but instead, they are just depleting our resources. Anderson use the analogy of the endangered pandas; it is like saying that in order to save the pandas, we need to eat the pandas. With 75% of the fish population gone, and our population continuing to rise, we need to find a better way to save the planet.

     <br><br>

But, that may not involve veganism. What Ken alluded to in this video is the idea of wasting LESS food. It does not take a diet change (although, that would help), and it in fact costs less. When Project Drawdown described the solution, I only thought about the first-world nations that have bountiful resources as wasters of our planet’s food. However, what I never even looked to is the idea that developing and underdeveloped countries can waste food too. As crops go bad, or as food is left unattended and inedible, those resources go to waste. Many families around the world, especially in America, buy more food than they consume. I know that personally, our family will buy groceries, leave it in the freezer, forget about it, and then end up throwing it out after it’s gone much past the expiration date. 
     <br><br>
But, the carbon footprint that this creates is enormous. So, what must we do? Eat, but eat efficiently. Spend less and eat just the same. Eat only what your body can handle, and as my grandmother would always say, “Don’t be wasteful.”

When watching the movie "Cowspiracy" I was very surprised to see how detrimental the whole agricultural industry is for our environment. I was specially astonished when the narrator of the movie said that more than half of the greenhouse emissions came from agriculture. I was really confused because I remember Ken talking about this and lecture and did not remember the number being so high. After watching Ken's video introducing the film I realize that the narrator was over exaggerating. Although the agriculture industry does play a large role in climate change it is nowhere near 50%/. I do have to say that this has lead me to question the credibility of the author. I now don't know how much of what he said to believe, since now I feel as he over exaggerated in order to change my view on something and his only purpose was to persuade me.
     <br><br>
There was a particular part from the film that to me was unbearable. I was not expecting the film to actually show when the duck was being slaughtered. This broke my heart. Although I know that all animals that are meant to be eaten have to be killed, actually seeing the action of the duck being beheaded made me feel extremely sad and even disgusted. I do feel like there should be some type of notice that this was coming, therefore each audience member is able to decide whether they would like to see this or not. Overall the movie did open my eyes as to how bad the agricultural industry is for the environment, although I do not know how much of this true or its the narrator just exaggerating the facts.

just like you I was a bit shocked when the narrator claimed that over half of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by agriculture. I mean, I knew that agriculture plays an extremely large role in the climate crisis, but even over half was an absurdly high number to believe. I agree that the narrator of ‘Cowspiracy” was definitely exaggerating, and this leads to some doubts concerning credibility. Still, the film’s core message, in my opinion, is that the agricultural industry is absolutely devastating our environment and accelerating the catastrophe that is climate change. Ken has said this several times before and it’s a point worth keeping in mind the next time anyone goes to the grocery store and considers buying some beef. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the fact that Ken brought up before, which is that one pound of beef requires the same amount of water as thirty pounds of lentils. 
     <br><br>

I was actually so horrified as well when the film showed the duck being killed! I had to look away - I actually have always wanted pet ducks because they’re one of my favorite animals. I felt absolutely disgusted and did not have the stomach to watch it. Although the scene probably could’ve used a trigger warning beforehand, it does drive home an additional message. Even if the agricultural industry weren’t causing mayhem for the environment, it’s also incredibly unethical and often times employs inhumane practices of slaughtering animals to be processed into packs of meat. That’s double the reason to be taking action against such a heinous industry, whether it’s through political action by electing officials or through even small personal amounts of action like boycotts and switching to a plant-based diet.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with your perspective about the credibility of the film makers and the fact that they’ve exaggerated one statistic (one that they repeated many many times throughout the film) you have to wonder how many other statistics and facts have they also fabricated or altered for a more of a dramatic impact. However, I still think it is super important to take into account all the rest of the information that was presented throughout the film. This was a film jam packed with so much information that when I was taking notes I took over 5 pages of notes. Therefore the information that was being presented is so much more important than the statistics being presented being slightly incorrect or exaggerated. At this point we are almost in dire need for some level of exaggeration that will prompt us into action! Some of the most interesting things that I found in the film were:
     <br><br>
1. 116,000 pounds of farm animal excitement is produced ever second in the US. Enough to cover San Francisco, New York City, Tokyo, Paris, New Delhi, Berlin, Hong Kong, London, Rio, Delaware, Bali, Costa Rica and Denmark combined. 
     <br><br>
2. Free living animals 10,000 years ago, made up 99% of the biomass, humans only made up of 1%. Today humans and animals we own make up 98% of biomass, and free living animals make up only 2%.
     <br><br>
3. Raising cattle consumes 1/3 of all fresh water, occupies 45% of Earth’s land, is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon destruction and is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean “Dead Zones” and habitat destruction.
     <br><br>
4. CO2 savings:
     <br><br>
- No Beef: 1.4 tons 
     <br><br>
- Vegetarian: 1.6 tons
     <br><br>
- Vegan: 1.8 tons 
     <br><br>
- Solar: 1.4 tons
     <br><br>
- Hybrid: 1.78 tons 
     <br><br>
- Electric Car: 2.5 tons 
     <br><br>
5. There are many hidden costs/ negative externalities of agriculture: health care, environmental damage, subsidies, damage to fisheries and even cruelty. These costs add up to $414 billion. If the meat and dairy producers internalized that cost the prices of meat and dairy would skyrocket, for example, a carton of eggs would go from $5 to $13 and a Big Mac would go from $4 to $11. So no matter what regulation we place on the meat industry we will always end up paying the price since it has become such an inelastic good! Something that we can change just by changing what we eat and our habits. 
     <br><br>

Another main thing that shocked me extremely was the danger behind speaking out against agribusiness around the world and how people were genuinely being prosecuted or killed for speaking out against livestock and agriculture. For example in Brazil over 1,100 activists have been included in the last 20 years, including José Carlos, Claudio and Dorothy Stang (a nun murdered by the agriculture business in a point blank shooting). This disgusts me and revolts me to no end to the point where I feel like I’m almost consuming things that are on the backs of these types of people. But what shocked me even more was that politics have even gained a strong hold over this. The idea of free speech in America is something I question as Howard Lyman was sued by Cattlemen for speaking the truth about animal agriculture on the Oprah Winfrey show, because of the Food disparagement law which states that it’s against the law to say something false about a perishable commodity. After all this information and watching the documentary I think that Howard was telling the complete truth and it’s kind of ironic because the ones that weren’t being transparent and telling the truth were the agriculture businesses. He was thankfully able to extricate himself from any charges but if he were to say the things he said today he definitely would’ve been guilty under the Patriot Act. In addition, most people would be shocked to learn that animal rights and environmental activists are the number 1 domestic terrorism threat according to the FBI. I’ve never heard in the FBI being so
     <br><br>
Interested in activism against a private industry and that really made me wonder about the level of power the agricultural industry has in the US And all over the world.
     <br><br>

Finally, I completely agree with you that the most heartbreaking and disturbing part of the whole documentary was the part where the duck was being slaughtered, I applaud you for being able to continue to watch the program but I personally couldn’t I had to skip it cuz it was absolutely heart breaking and a sight I never wanted to see. I’ve never internalized the guilt so much seeing as I see meat and eat meat almost everyday as just another piece of food but I don’t account for where it’s come from or what it was before and seeing it first hand was absolutely heartbreaking and I was to put it lightly disgusted with myself and my habits.

After watching the film “Cowspiracy”, I realized that what caused the continuously expanding agriculture without limit is basically because of people’s ignorance of the fact that agriculture brings a large proportion of greenhouse gasses emission. According to Ken, 15 percent of carbon emission comes from agriculture. Although this is much less than 51 percent proposed in the film, it is already a very significant proportion. Among the climate and environment authorities, few of them are aware of the fact that agriculture and animal product contribute such a large amount to the carbon emission. Most simply don’t take this problem seriously. On the problem of fishing, Oceana believes that we are living on the interest that is generated from the ocean continuously, however, the consumption of fish has already left us in debt. Given the fact, Oceana still encourage people to eat more fish in order to protect in environment. Well, this is a way, but we’re looking at the wrong source of fish. In the rivers in American, river fish, such as carp and crucian, has overwhelmed the interior water ecosystem in America and killing other species. If there is so much consumption of fish, why wouldn’t people just eat more river fish which are easier to catch rather than sea fish which are already dangerously low in stock? It doesn’t make sense. In addition to the alternative to sea fish, the production of other animals should also decrease. Taxes should be imposed on meat and planting wheat, potatoes, and vegetables should be encouraged.

The film "Cowspiracy" really surprised me on how much water is used a single burger. Those $1 dollar burgers cost 660 gallons of water. I knew the Animal- agriculture business was a huge waste of resources, however when the documentary showed how much we were wasting, it really put it into perspective. 34 trillion gallons of water are used on the beef industry and it is absolutely destroying the planet. Also that for every one fish we capture for consumption, 5 fish are killed as the by product. It makes all the efforts we've made in saving sharks from the Chinese consumption of shark fin soup seem trivial as we are throwing the sharks away without even consuming them which is worse then what we were doing with the soups.
     <br><br>


Another thing that shocked me was the ability to keep everything under wraps in the beef industry. the people that controlled those aspects of agriculture were hiring people to kill activists who were actively fighting against it which was shocking. I didn't expect such a high level of corruption in those countries. Not only that but even in America, these people are being hunted by the FBI for trying to speak the truth. Now days it's more common to know that the beef industry is an issue but its only been in the last few years that this has come to light.

After watching cowspiracy it reconfirms one of the reasons why I greatly cutback on eating meat in the first place. The other reason why I cut back on meat is due to how much of a negative impact consuming meat has on one's health. I can't say I am a strict vegan, I'm not even very close to that. In all honesty I really only eat turkey. I realize a vegan can call me out on this and say I'm not doing my part, but I like to think I'm slowly getting there. The film cowspiracy has personally helped reassure me that I am making an impact, but I also could be doing more. As Ken points out how some of the facts are not correct within the film, I think the exaggeration is necessary to get the attention of others who are not as aware.

The facts that were presented in Cowspiracy really shocked me. I knew that eating less meat and consuming less animal products was good for the environment, but I had no idea just how much damage I was doing by continuing to consume these products. Knowing these statistics have definitely made  me reconsider eating meat. I already eat very little meat but if I could save acres of rainforests by skipping out on this luxury, it's worth a shot. I think educating people on these statistics mentioned in Cowspiracy, like that animal agriculture uses 34 trillion gallons of water a year, it might encourage more people to make that switch. In addition, the way to educate people on how to replace the nutrients from meat with vegetables. Some reasons I heard of people not becoming vegan or vegetarian is that they don’t know how to do that and don’t want to be lacking. 
       <br><br>
  I was also surprised to hear that all these environmental activist organizations were not addressing the damage that agriculture and raising livestock do when it’s such a significant part of our environmental footprint. How could something like this go ignored by the people and organizations made to focus on these issues? The fact that Greenpeace, a very large environmental organization,  refused to be interviewed says a lot about how transparent they are being when it comes to their knowledge and lack of action on the subject. Sadly, like any other organization, the power is held by those with money and speaking against them will result in the loss of funding. So they basically are left to choose the lesser of two evils. It’s either they act on only certain environmental issues or they lose the power to act on any when they lose funding. Although there is power in numbers and we each have the power to make an impact, our society is largely controlled by money right now and it buys access and influence.

After watching Cowspiracy, I was not really shocked by the fact that the beef industry is such a large producer of greenhouse gasses, however, I learned a lot about many different industries and the ways in which they impact the climate. I found the interviews interesting because the filmmakers gave a platform to many livestock organizations who were unable to effectively defend their actions. I think they were good with holding them accountable. All the different perspectives were very interesting to see, and I appreciated the broad range of industries that were represented. This documentary pushed me further to committing to vegetarianism, which I have been transitioning into recently. I think it was well-made with generally good intentions.

Cowspiracy was a film that had a huge impact on my life the first time I saw it. Given this was my freshman year of high school and this past year I have fallen back into some of the bad habits I walked away from after watching this movie, I decided I should watch it again. After watching this film the first time around, I completely cut dairy out from my diet. From my freshman year of high school until about 8 months ago (a total of 4 years), I was mainly dairy free. (I say mainly because if I’m honest the occasional hankering for ice cream was too much to resist but otherwise there really was nothing else). I was the only one in my family who had stopped, but luckily they were supportive and there was always almond milk in the fridge for me or something I was able to snack on. I’m afraid though that the past year of living on my own though and with the social pressure my new college friends have brought on me I’ve started consuming dairy again. I guess one could say it was time for me to remind myself of why I stopped in the first place. This film homework was well timed to rewatch Cowspiracy. 
         <br><br>
  Although a lot of the statistics in this movie have actually been disproven and as Ken mentioned, over exaggerated, I still think that it holds a great message. Even if you choose to ignore the environmental impacts of livestock farming, the investigation on the power of meat companies is astonishing. The lobbying and funding and influence on our government by these companies is something that absolutely cannot be overlooked. I enjoyed watching this film again and although (no pun intended) it was cheesier than I remembered, I still found it incredibly impactful.

I found the film "Cowspiracy" to be one of the more interesting films that we have watched in this class. I feel like this film brings up a lot of important points that many people do not really think about. Something that I found particularly interesting was how so many different organizations that claim to be eco-friendly are actually not. While watching the filmmakers question some of the leaders of these organizations it was very frustrating to see them avoid certain questions completely. I feel like this film makes a very important argument because so many people are still not aware of how harmful the agriculture industry is on the environment. However, I find it extremely shocking and frustrating to see the amount of people who are aware of this huge issue,  still refuse to cut back on their meat consumption. It is really not difficult at all to simply cut back on how much meat we eat. I feel like this is such an incredibly simple and easy solution, that people are just too stubborn to participate in. While I found this film to be very educational and important, I did find that by falsifying such an important fact the narrator lost a certain amount of credibility.

I agree with you that the film “Cowspiracy” does a good job of showing that many organizations that claim to be eco-friendly actually aren’t. I didn’t think that these people would try and blame any other thing, but agriculture and live-stock. I knew that we all should start eating a mostly plant-based diet, but I didn’t know that it takes so much to just create a single hamburger.
          <br><br>
It is shocking to see the amount of facts and statistics behind the claim that the documentary was trying to get at, but people still wouldn’t accept it. Although it is hard and something that will have to take a lot of self-control, lowering our own meat-consumption is vital to our planet. How do we expect everything to be okay if we are not willing to make sacrifices? The way that we are treating our planet just so that we can have a burger or a steak is absurd. This documentary opened my eyes to the reality of the agriculture and livestock industry. I knew that it was not good to consume meat, but I never really knew the facts behind it. Now, I am better able to understand why this is an issue that companies don’t want to display and that many other people try to hide just so that they could keep making a profit.

While I was watching the film this week, I caught myself becoming more and more shocked as the film continued at the sheer ignorance towards animal well being when it comes to the food industry. The fact that major players in the meat industry see nothing wrong with their gross mistreatment of animals horrifies me. On the topic of veganism and vegetarianism, I believe that many people think that becoming either vegan or vegetarian would have little to no impact since they’re only one person and the meat industry serves billions around the world. Although this may seem like a valid point, we fail to realize that millions of people probably have the same thoughts. Now, if we do the math, if these million plus people decide to all go vegan and ignore the singularity of it, the change would have a profound impact on how much meat is produced and will reduce emissions greatly just by skipping the steak for a few or all the meals during the week. Since food production causes a lot of emissions, I believe that making the lifestyle change could decrease global emissions by a lot. I may now even consider going vegetarian myself if it means I can help save our home and the only planet that we live on.

I loved how you pointed out how the film showed the ignorance of the health of the animals that were being used in the food industry. Whether they be slaughtered or harvested for eggs and milk, the way these animals are treated are not humane at all. And many of the people feel like this mistreatment does not affect us directly, so they are able to turn a blind eye. But take for example the Chicken we eat. They are pumped full of so many antibiotics in their living days, so that companies like Foster Farms can protect their investment and their chicken will not die or get sick before being fully grown to be killed and sold. This antibiotic usage leads to our bodies not seeing antibiotics as powerful as they used to be. When we eat these chickens, we also consume the antibiotics it was pumped with, causing the effect stated above. The inhumane nature of Factory Animal Farming needs to be regulated, especially with the treatment and living conditions of animals and the antibiotic usage. You also stated how a lifestyle change towards veganism reduces personal emissions, as well as lowering your own personal demand for the meat and animal products. If millions made this change, it would be a real hit on their profits which may trigger a change in factory farming.

I did not expect to be as emotionally impacted as I was by "Cowspiracy". I think that so far, this is the film that will stick with me the most. The way the film is structured perfectly encompasses the true issues of the agriculture business. I'm also glad to have Ken address the film, and the fact that incorrect facts are used. I still think, that despite this incorrect number on the percentage that agriculture takes up in regards to releasing CO2, the film is still important. 
          <br><br>

I had no idea how many people are willing to hide the truth behind animal agriculture. Every time Kip talked to a person in power in an "eco friendly" company, I kept expecting them to agree with him. However, each time I was disappointed. It is clear how money can easily change peoples morals, or rather display their true morals. I like how the film started out with this line of questioning, while incorporating facts about agribusiness along the way. It was very effective in making me realize how even people who claim to be environmental activists, aren't actually doing their part. 
          <br><br>

This was a perfect buildup to their main point. Activists need to actually start showing rather than talking about the changes that need be made. I wonder how many people in our class consider themselves Environmental activists yet still eat a lot of meat... or still fly a lot...or don't recycle... the list goes on! This film made me far more aware. of the fact that action is desperately needed. 
          <br><br>

I also found it interesting how the film closed with the overarching concept off overpopulation. This is a key part of the agriculture business, and I think it is an important issue to address, however the placement of it in the film was odd. Overall, I found this film to every impactful, and recommend it to people who are skeptical about changing to a plant based diet.

I have the exact same feeling as you since I was also very deeply emotionally impacted by this film. Every time when the protagonist entered a globally famous environmental protection organization and ask them what is the leading cause of climate change, they would all reply with this uniform response: industries, factories, transportation… but none of them mentioned animal agriculture. What shocked me the most is when the protagonist listed the many evidence he gathered from scientific research and statistic publications, those so-called environmental activists still refused to admit that animal agriculture plays a significant part in this issue. Most of them would still insist that animal agriculture is not the leading factor, as long as to their knowledge. I could clearly remember this one lady executive director laughed and said, “cow farts,” it’s “just cow farts.” It’s ironic to see these people entitled themselves as progressive environmental activists, but their contributions and awareness of the climate issues are way less passionate than this protagonist, who actually kept doing small things such as taking shorter showers and drive less. I, too, feel the desperate need of action after watching this film. If all of us are just playing with our promising words, then even watching thousands of this film would not help. Action is the only thing that matters.

I have to admit that this video is mind-blowing to me, even though I knew beef production can be harmful to the environment, I still didn’t have an idea about how it exerts an impact on use of water. 
           <br><br>
At the beginning of the video, it starts the video with a quote of Martin Luther King Jr.’s, “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends”. This gives a perfect summary of the whole video, to criticize the silence of people towards the animal raising industries. Additionally, the video also gives another clip about an old man, Bruce Hamilton, who is the Deputy executive director, talking about global warming. At the beginning, he is very worried about the consequences of our action on our own living environment. He is concerned about the large famine, droughts and human conflicts that will be caused by global warming. However, sarcastically, when others ask about the impact of animal agriculture on the environment, he seems doesn’t have a clue about it at all. 
           <br><br>
In the film, it mentions that raising livestock in U.S. consumes 34 trillion of water. Compares to the production of natural gas, this is a huge consumption. As the video states that eating one hamburger is the equivalent of showering two months. This statistic is staggering. Now I know why reducing food wastes is the important way to reduce carbon emission and protect the environment.

I have to agree with you; I was also thoroughly shocked by the content of this film. Before watching, I knew a lot about this topic because my mom teaches it. She wrote a textbook on food ethics and talks to me all the time about our relationship with food. But there was so much content in this film that I did not know. The beef industry is so disgusting and damaging to our environment. It is sickening. I really liked the quote that Lyu uses in his comment to summarize the film: “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.” This really gets at the heart of the issue. Silence is not going to cut it. Some people somewhere have to stand up and start actively trying to educate and make change. There were a few parts of the film that I want to bring up that were especially jarring. Firstly, animal agriculture is the top cause of both deforestation and water consumption. Secondly, animal agriculture is a greater emitter of greenhouse gases than the transportation industry. Thirdly, and lastly, methane has a global warming potential over 20 years that is 86 times that of CO2.

The film, "Cowspiracy", details the destructiveness of the animal agriculture industry by showing facts on the environmental impact of the animal farming industry and underscoring how the detriments of that industry is mostly ignored. For example, the film tells us that livestock and their byproducts account for 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. It also shows shockingly graphic content about the animals’ horrible treatment in the farms.

I learned about how much the negative effects of animal agriculture are ignored in society because of the power agribusiness wields. The film also changed my attitude on environmental organizations who are supposedly supposed to help climate change. I didn’t realize how inactive most of these organizations, who are supposed to be out fighting climate change, were. This film left me feeling disappointed because there are slim chances that the animal agriculture industry will slow down enough to prevent more damage to the environment. Not enough people are willing to change their eating habits, therefore the meat industry will continue.

After watching ”Cowspiracy”, I was not surprised at how industries work and push agendas in favor of their profit. This quarter has reminded us time and time again that big corporations continue to ignore the issue of climate change as something that doesn't exist, which ultimately seeps down into consumers who wouldn't know any better because they aren't educated on the topic. I didn't know that a plant based diet would be the best way to combat climate change as an individual, but after learning so it’s still hard for me to see everybody making that change altogether. Yes, I understand that it's a change that isn't impossible, but such a cultural change in meat consumption seems like an idea far off in the future with how ingrained our diets are.

The film Cowspiracy moved me more than any of the films we've seen so far. Much like the narrator Kip Andersen, I was a bit choked up after watching the duck beheaded, as I had never seen that before either. A bit choked up is generous really, truthfully as soon as the blade came down and blood started flowing, my tears did as well, ultimately turning into full blown sobbing as the duck's body continued spasming long after. Kip's statement that if he couldn't kill it, then he felt someone shouldn't kill it for him resonated most with me. I didn't eat much meat before watching this film, but now I'm not sure I can stomach the thought of any. I hope that my despair and heartbreak for the duck and all the other slaughtered animals stays with me long after watching this film, so I can continue to fight any meating cravings that may arise. 
          <br><br>

A few other lines from this film stuck out so distinctly to me that I actually added them to a growing list of quotes that I write down to hold near and dear. The first: "You can't be an environmentalist and eat animal products, period." The idea was put forth in the film that 75% of Americans consider themselves environmentalists, and if just this portion simply lived their mantra and didn't eat meat, that the effects would be incredible. The second quote being "Do what you can do as well as you can do it every day of your life and you will end up dying one of the happiest individuals to ever die." Considering that we all seem to me in a constant pursuit of happiness, I think that we'd all do well to keep this idea in mind. One simple and relatively easy example of this is being environmentalists who practice what we preach. Not eating meat/animal products could be an easy thing to check off of doing environmentalism as best as we can.

While starting this film I already had some preconceived thoughts about the food industry that I had learned from my own experiences and this class. I knew the beef industry in particular took major parts of land and the CO2 emissions from them were ridiculously high, but to find out that “animal agriculture is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse” which is more than all the greenhouse gases from transportation exhaust was eye opening. I also discovered that the waste or byproducts of all the livestock is also massive and largely responsible for the crisis we are in. Another major factor that I had learned about but was more informed on was methane. I knew methane was hurting our environment similar to CO2 but I did not know that methane is way more destructive than CO2. A sad realization that I found out from this film is that not only is the agriculture emission incredibly high right now they are only going to increase. In fact they are going to increase 80% by 2050, holyshit. Raising all the animals emit huge amounts of carbon emissions and their main solutions to stop these are a long way away due to money and preconceived notions about them. Americans aren't just going to sit there and have their steak and burgers be taken away they're going to fight for them and the government most likely wouldn't even anyway due to the large amount of economic benefactors they provide. The agriculture industry is killing our environment and if we don't enact major changes we are all going to die :D .

Wasted was an eye-opening film to say the least. I had known for quite some time that wasting food was a “bad thing” but I had no idea about the numbers…For example:

          <br><br>

1/3 of all food produced is never eaten
          <br><br>


Over 90% of food waste ends up in the U.S landfills

          <br><br>

The annual cost of food waste is 1 trillion dollars!

          <br><br>

It is the biggest cause of deforestation, water usage, habitat and biodiversity loss 

          <br><br>


10 million tons of produce go unharvested each year

          <br><br>

These are just a few examples of some eye-opening statistics revealed during this film. I remember when I was young and I lived at home, my mom would always tell us that we have to eat and finish everything on our plates before getting up from the table. This habit was installed in me and my siblings my whole life even after I left home. For a long time, I would feel guilty if there were times when I left a lot of food uneaten and I was sick of feeling that way. 2 things that helped me not have to waste food and feel bad about it is 1) Meal Prep or “slow food.” Instead of eating on the spot, I plan out my weekly meals and everything I buy gets used up and I have plenty of food to eat during the week (it takes longer than fast food, but it saves you a lot of money!) and 2) I stopped eating at restaurants as much because I noticed their portions were always too much and I could never finish anything I ordered which left me feeling like I wasted food and my money. I know our culture likes things fast and easy, but meal prepping has saved me at least $200 a month in food spending. You just have to commit 2-3 hours a week to buying and prepping food. 
          <br><br>
One of the ideas in this film for bread waste that I really loved that was in England (I think), the bear “Toast Ale” was replacing 1/3 of its grain with wasted bread. The wasted bread is perfectly normal bread (mainly the ends of breads) and each bottle contains about 1 piece of bread. This was such a creative and productive way to use food waste and the consumers couldn’t even taste a difference and everyone loved it. “You can have a party while drinking your way out of this problem [food waste].” I loved this quote because it goes to show doing something to help solve a problem such as food waste can be fun and yummy!

After watching the documentary Cowspiracy, which reveals the incredible impact of large livestock farms on the earth's ecological environment, and the impact is absolutely devastating. was extremely interested in the author. People around me always mention the effects that posed by factories, transportation, housing to the climate change, but no one pays attention to food. This is an interesting perspective. Consequently, I searched for the introduction of the author. Director Jeep Anderson became an environmentalist after watching the 2006 environmental film "the hard truth to ignore.". In his daily life, he began to recycle materials, turn off lights, save water, and often cycle to work, low-carbon travel. In 2014, he found a film theme about environmental protection that he never paid attention to: animal husbandry. I really admire Anderson, because I think he is working on the most essential problem for the current society. To be honest, after learning English 23, I concern about the environment deeply and I am considering what I can do for it in every lectures. I want to be next generation of researchers of Anderson who keep working on this serious topic. If I continue to delve into this topic, I can't imagine what will happen. It seems that the only right decision is to put down the camera and walk away, but I realize that this problem is too big to worry about. This is related to all life on the earth. Because of our actions, we are in danger. You can fight for your ideals or die for mediocrity. I have no other choice. I decide not to surrender or fear the secret. I want to find out the truth just like Anderson. I can't look at the earth as swallowed but ignore it like those environmental organizations.

"Cowspiracy" is one of the only films we've watched that has me not quite knowing where I stand on it. On the one hand, it does a great job of making people rethink their eating choices (after I did watch it, I stopped eating beef entirely and I avoid try to avoid meat when I can) but it also provides false information and still leaves large portions of the food industry and their impact on the climate left to question. I wonder if the false information was provided on purpose, to greater alarm people, or if it was indeed just mistaken research, but either way it worries me about the implications it presents.
          <br><br>
When I showed some of the information to my father, a very conservative man who doesn't believe in the climate crisis, he pulled up other information to disprove what was in the video. I admitted that yes, some of those facts were fudged, but the overall message is still largely true, but he wouldn't have it. Once he found out one of the facts were wrong, he assumed they all were, and thus said that he can't trust any of the facts about the supposed climate crisis. After all, if one whole documentary was rewritten to fit an agenda, why not more? Why can't all this information be falsified? These thoughts are what I worry many will come to if they watch Cowspiracy and find out much of it was wrong. While I do support the message, it doesn't do entirely good in spreading that message, and for that, I cannot fully support this documentary.

I completely agree with you, I did not know where I stood on the problem after watching this film. I actually watched the film before watching the lecture video. When I watched the film I thought to myself how deeply worrying all the facts were and I was so pissed off at the companies for shoving all the facts down. But directly after watching the film and hearing Ken say that instead of the cattle industry being responsible for 51% of the greenhouse emissions, it was 15% I brain immediately went back 10 steps. The film made me think about living a vegetarian life style but when Ken said it could be more sustainable to waste less food, I went back on it. This is why I partly agree with your dad here the fact that Kip fudged some of the numbers that dramatically had me not trusting much of what was said in the film. It made me not trust him just as I don't trust the climate deniers or some of the environmental companies. I still completely acknowledge that it's a huge issue in the world, 15% is still a lot, and there was no need to change the stats because it is a big problem in itself. 
          <br><br>
Just as I stopped trusting everything in Kip's documentary, I feel like I lost some trust for the environmental movements as well. Kip mentions they are  political movements who rely on funding and if they start to become anti meat, they lose some of their funding and disregard what's truly at hand. Types of facts like this is what is so confusing about the climate crisis. I feel like I am going back and forth on what to believe. In the reading, I gain hope for the world with all the solutions at hand then I lose hope after watching cowspiracy, then I gain hope again after learning it's really less bad than it is. It's all so confusing, I don't blame anyone who doesn't trust a lot of the facts and figures they read and hear.

While watching "Cowspiracy," I thought about people who care about the climate crisis and take action, even if they do not live by a plant-based diet. I wish this film acknowledged the fact that even if people do not become vegetarian or vegan, they are still making changes in order to reduce their carbon footprint. However, this film disregards people who do not eat plant-based. Just because someone is not eating plant-based does not mean that they are not taking action. I know several people who speak upon relevant topics like environmental injustice and take action by being part of organizations and by voting. I am not going against plant-based diets, in fact I adopted to it myself, but I am saying that people should not be disregarded for not being vegetarian or vegan. We should also acknowledge the ways that some of these people are trying to address the issue and contribute to change. Even if people are not plant-based, they contribute through other ways that include taking public transportation and voting. I believe that voting and taking public transportation should also be considered power moves in taking action against the climate crisis. For some people it is not easy to go plant based, but it is important to note that they ARE trying to change their ways like everyone else.

Cowspiracy is a very informative film that taught me a lot about some of the lesser known sources of environmental destruction. Honestly, this documentary instilled a bit of paranoia in me. It was scary to watch well-respected organizations like the Sierra Club shadily withhold information regarding the harmfulness of agriculture industries in the United States. It is terrifying that organizations like this, ones responsible for protecting our planet, prioritize anything but spreading the whole truth about the climate crisis. The destructive nature of agriculture practice in the US should not be disguised behind other causes for the climate crisis. It was so disappointing to watch major organizations like this, as well as governmental bureaus, clearly try to dodge Kip’s attempt to cast a light on the the massive issue of the livestock industry. 
          <br><br>
From my time in this class, I was already aware of many of the consequences of agriculture industries but this film offered jarring statistics and analogies that really helped me understand the horrifying severity of this issue. I had no idea that 91% of Amazon deforestation was in order to clear land for the agriculture industries. I suppose I had never really considered the reason for deforestation but knowing how land-intensive the agriculture industry is, I am not surprised that this is the main reason for it. 
          <br><br>
The sheer inefficiency of eating meat needs to be made aware to more Americans in order for there to be any real behavioral change on a large scale. Water waste alone makes omnivorism already of dubious morality but when the methane emissions are factored in as well, eating meat is really awful. I felt great guilt watching the statistics of the amount of waste in the production of just one burger. I hate thinking about how much water I have wasted by eating burgers. 660 gallons per hamburger is actually ridiculous to me. The analogy painted by the image of the overflowing hose in the yard really showed that this is an out of sight of mind issue for most people. I really do admire Kip for his persistence throughout the course of this documentary. I want to fully cut out meat from my diet one day. I am going to start by avoiding beef because that seems like the primary contributor to this crisis.

In the movie Cowspiracy my eyes were really opened to how shady the agriculture industry was. Everyone knows the tobacco and oil industries are full of some bad people but I never would have expected the agriculture industry to go to the extent of killing people. When you think of the agriculture industry you imagine some humble old farmer raising his cattle or growing his crops not bothering anyone. Maybe this is the picture the industry paints so people don't question what they're doing because you think to yourself "Oh they wouldn't do that" when in reality the industry is really messed up. From the treatment of the animals and the way crops are handled to they way they just cover everything up with the government's help. Again I'm very against big corporations being able to lobby congress members to get what they want. It's sick and a way to give people with money immunity as long as they give their "generous donations" to the congress member of their choice. Also in other countries, how people are going missing and being killed over the matter is just wrong. Dorothy Stang was a 74 year old Nun who unfortunately was killed over the matter for protecting the Amazon from deforestation. Who in their right ind could honestly do such a thing. It's sickening what money could do to people and the demons that it could bring out. Its sad that there are more sustainable practices that could be done but they do not profit the same. The people with money don't like that so they simply ignore the fact. Just like the tobacco and oil industries, agriculture knows exactly what it's doing. Blatantly lying to the general public advertising that keeping animals indoors is better for their overall health when in reality the living conditions are significantly worse. As this course progresses it really makes me reflect on what I'm doing to contribute to this madness. I always thought that I was very responsible and tried my best to help the planet but to find out my small efforts have little to no impact as my driving and diet are huge contributors to the problem.

"We are the weather" is a really good name. I think it is very true that we are controlling the future destiny of our plant, either in a good direction or in a bad direction. After watching the video, I realized that the meat industry is actually a big factory that produces carbon footprint. The expansion of livestocks and farming caused deforestation. Trees are cut, wild animals lose their habitats. This leads to the extinction of many species and decrease the biodiversity on the planet. Still most people on this planet are not vegan, they consume meat constantly, which produces greenhouse gases constantly. However, it is very hard to change their behaviors, because meat is delicious. Maybe, finishing all the food on the plate and eliminating the food wasting could be the first goal to achieve for everyone.

           <br><br>


This film makes me think that I have not done everything to protect the environment. It opened my thoughts, and I think I will behave more environmentally friendly in the future and persuade others around me to watch this film. And let them think as well that eating meat can cause CO2 emissions. It is also important to ask those companies that sell livestock meats to declare on their label about the CO2 emission. Just like the cigarette labels, it can at least prevent many people from buying it and can change many people's eating habits.



</p><hr>


<p>

Towards the end, the idea of efficiency came up directly; Dr. Greg Litus said ‘Not only is veganic more compassionate, it’s also more efficient.’ Given that American culture is based off of getting what we want in the quickest, most accessible ways possible, I wonder if changes in our diet were presented to the general population as such. For example, now with things like the Beyond Burger, people are incentivized to purchase and consume this product not just because it’s a great (though still water-guzzling) alternative to a beef burger, but also because it’s becoming a societal trend. 

           <br><br>

I think the commodification of eating vegetarian or vegan has great potential to be the catalyst of change for the livestock industry in the US but also has the potential to make these eating changes seem like passing fads. If we truly want to pursue sustainable methods of eating, people need to know that these methodologies are not only the most efficient way of producing and distributing nutritious foods, but that making these changes are not difficult and that these changes will not be temporary.

After watching "Cowspiracy," I feel like I have a better grasp on just how detrimental to the environment raising livestock and growing crops specifically for livestock has become, with the United States being a dominant force in the consumption and production of meat. Dairy and beef seem like such an integral part of not only the American diet but the diets of many other nations as well. I understand that consuming beef takes a considerable toll on the environment, but I can't help but wonder what environmentalists and climate change activists have to say to the significance of meat in some cultures; Argentinians have many beef dishes, Spaniards and Viet people consume a lot of seafood, and it seems like trends like Korean BBQ have gained a lot of popularity even in the States in the past few years. I know for me personally, were I to go vegetarian or even vegan, my family simply wouldn't know what to make for lunch or dinner because we have some form of meat or animal products in practically every dish; none of my immediate or even distant family members are vegetarian or vegan. 

           <br><br>

However, all that being said, I feel that the cultural aspect of food remains the only compelling defense for justifying consuming meat on a semi-regular or regular basis. To have the Markegard family say, "We don't feel like livestock have a carbon footprint" would be like saying electric cars don't have a carbon footprint; there are aspects to both that occur behind the scenes that contribute immensely to our global carbon footprint. While giving cattle grass and more land to roam and graze does promote the ethical treatment of livestock and a healthy end-product, it is by no means an efficient, sustainable method for producing food. At the same time, I can understand how "a couple ounce a week" of dairy and completely omitting red meat from one's diet can seem drastic and too limiting given how dairy seems to find its way into so many common foods like ice cream, coupled with the fact that beef can be found everywhere, from your local fast food joint to a high-end steakhouse. Are there sustainable, similar alternatives to dairy and red meat? Probably. But America and a lot of other nations are going to need a lot of convincing to incorporate these alternatives into their regular diets and completely abolish the prevalence of dairy and beef in so many of the foods we eat. The cattle industry is guaranteed to fight any opposition to their lucrative industry.

<p>

Watching this film made me feel how people need to be educated about the climate crisis or else it will be too late. As seen in the film, even people who are committed to helping the environment are not truly informed about what is causing the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The first guy in the film who lived in the farm did not know about the effects of cattle on the environment similar to much of the people in the world. And even within the world of animal treatment, the ideal of grassfed beef which sounds like a better method of raising cows is actually more harmful for the environment compared to even factory farmed meat. I believe that this is due to a combination of beef interests making an effort to not have this information being widespread in addition to people simply not knowing. 
           <br><br>
The cattle companies in this film basically all say how they are doing good or not bad for the environment when they are in fact doing the opposite. Though I feel like it would be difficult to fully erase the cattle industry, I believe that the first step is to admit that there is a problem so people can work together to solve this problem instead of completely denying it and prolonging the inevitable issue.

"Cowspiracy" was quite honestly incredibly difficult and frustrating for me to watch. It makes the environmental crisis look so incredibly unsolvable that I was discouraged after it ended. This is firstly because the statistics are incredibly alarming. When I heard that eating 1 hamburger would use as much water as it would take to shower for two months,  I immediately texted my dad, who is still very meat obsessed, and told him to be conscious of his decisions. People think that one small choice to eat meat one day makes no difference, but this movie shows that clearly it does. Additionally, this movie is frustrating because despite the fact that I am trying my best to minimize my impact and I have started eating vegetarian, I have the realistic understanding that a lot of America will not be willing to do the same. It's like what is said in the movie, which is that over 75% of the population considers themselves an environmental activist, but in reality people are not willing to make sacrifices in their own lives. It's not enough to post stories on instagram and encourage people to believe in climate disruption. People need to give up the things they think they deserve to actually have their individual impact make a difference.

After watching “Cowspiracy,” I learned from Ken’s introduction that “animal production accounts for about 15% of global greenhouse emission, not over 50% as stated in the film.” This casts some suspicion, at least for me, as the numbers are significantly different. We do not know what other facts may be wrong regarding the evidences supporting Kip Andersen’s claims. However, I do believe that the film allows its viewers to reconsider their actions concerning meat and the animal production industry. It absolutely disgust me that a representative of the livestock company murdered environmental advocate Dorothy Stang. I was also surprised by how environmental organizations refused to acknowledge the large impact that animal production had in destroying our environment. It goes to show that people are more motivated by gaining money than by having a sustainable planet to live on even though without a sustainable planet to live on, having all the money in the world would not matter. This documentary really opened my eyes regarding the background of the meat I consumed before. Before watching this film, I knew that meat consumption was bad for the environment, but I did not know to what extent.

“Cowspiracy” is effective at communicating its subject which is pointing out that animal agriculture is actually the leading cause of environmental destruction such as deforestation, water pollution, etc. Anderson presents a lot of data and interviews to support his argument, especially those interviews that show animal agriculture is such a sensitive topic to talk about, which makes this film more convincing. I learned that animal agriculture is actually causing huge destruction in our environment and the fact that we over cultivate plants and over-fishing in order to run animal agriculture. It makes me feel that while keep doing all the stuff we already know to save the environment, we should eat less meat as well. After watching it, I feel more pessimistic because it seems the leading agents of organizations of environmental protection are not going to take action and that not everyone is willing to change their eating habits, it is a tough problem to solve.



</span></div><hr>

<p>
The first thing that stood out to me was the interview with the two men who worked for the CA Department of water resources. Did the interviewer really believe that those two men have control over the information being put out? The expressions on their faces screamed “If I answer this question wrong, I might lose my job”. It is not up to low standing government officials to make change in our flawed system. This is seen in more detail farther in the film. No wonder none of these officials want to say anything about animal agriculture. The power and reach of agriculture business is so great that people who speak out are in danger of losing their jobs or their lives. Animal agriculture along with fossil fuels put money in politicians pockets and have control over government and policy. When you really look out how deeply flawed this political system is, I am reminded of some dystopian young adult novel. 
           <br><br>
I also noticed that some of their figures that are being compared do not line up. They compared projected CO2 emissions but used different years. This gives an inaccurate portrayal of the comparison. I agree with the overall message of this film, animal agriculture is not sustainable, but I do not agree with how they presented information.
           <br><br>
I found it ironic that the Markegard family said that Brazil shouldn’t be eating cattle because they’re land was not made for grazing, when cows are not a naturally occurring phenomena. How can you say your land was created to graze an animal that was man made through selective breeding?
           <br><br>
I found the point that we the citizens are the ones paying for the impacts of animal agriculture very impactful. It doesn’t matter if you eat meat or not, you are paying for the corruption of these companies and their detrimental effect on the environment.

I agree, it seemed that a lot of the people that were interviewed chose their words carefully when the topic of animal agriculture came out. It was also surprising that ecological activists were considered the number one domestic terrorism threat. Even if the emissions numbers were wrong, it was still crazy to know that the people that tried to speak out against animal agriculture became targets for the industry. With the amount of money involved, the animal industry easily can discard of or prevent someone from speaking out again. Much like fossil fuel companies, the money is so tempting for people and anything that can decrease business for these industries, they will take any path necessary to stop it in order to make even more money.

"Cowspiracy" was a great film showcasing the destruction that the food industry causes and how organizations are not willing to have a voice on it. Animal agriculture is the leading cause of the destruction of forests, the consumption of water, and the consequences of pollution for greenhouse gases. These three factors are far more responsible for more greenhouse gases than transportation, and the leading cause of rainforest deforestation, extinction, and environmental destruction. Andersen approaches leaders and organizations in the environmental movement, he unveils the refusal to discuss the issue of animal agriculture. This film how portrays what we eat reflects how land, water, and other natural resources are exploited, contributing to climate change and an unhealthy future for humans, biodiversity and the environment. By reducing the livestock we produce and converting to a plant-based diet, it can help reduce our carbon footprint but the reality of that ever happening is unlikely due to the fact that companies and organizations resent the fact the livestock contributes to climate change. Personally, this film made me reflect on my lifestyle and other people that I currently live with. Looking at our fridge and freezer, we remove about 50 percent of the meet we purchase and seeing how much the production of meats contributes to greenhouse gas emissions makes me feel like a big contributor.

One of the things said in Cowspiracy that shocked me was when it was stated that the transportation and energy sectors are understandably given a lot of attention due to the terrible impact on our environment by its CO2 emissions, but animal agriculture produces 65% of the world's nitrous oxide--a gas with a global warming potential 296 times greater than CO2 per pound. Ken was not kidding when he said the first half of the class is really depressing. Last week I learned how detrimental planes were and now I'm discovering about how dangerous animal agriculture is. What also caught my attention was the lack of willingness to talk about the subject matter from the environmental organizations. But at the same time, I am also not surprised, many food companies/industries' reputation would be under attack and therefore could hurt their income. In other words, just like the fossil fuel industry, these agricultural businesses are most likely motivated by money. Maybe this is just me being pessimistic (which is something I realized about myself as this course goes on), but I know people can be very materialistic, to recap from last week people want the latest fashion and latest iPhone, they want the best car and want to travel in planes, etc. Even with fast fashion, car and plane industries, tech industries and more being under attack for their detrimental affects to the planet, if there's one thing that people might even love more, it would be food. Thus making me come to the conclusion of a question I had proposed to myself earlier, "why do I never see animal agriculture being blamed/being held accountable?"---well it's because we love our food, more specifically our beef, chicken, and pork. I want to believe if we had the chance to trade in our car as long as we can keep our meat loving diet, I think many people would do it. I think deep down, people know about the dangers that animal agriculture is putting our planet through, but they turn the other cheek because we all want to keep it. To be very blunt, trying to implement changed behavior is already hard enough, but I think people rather see cars and planes and fossil fuels and fashion and technology take the fall over food. I think there are people out there who think, maybe if we make all the big changes we need to in terms of the energy and technology sector, then we can keep our animal agriculture, which is why this topic is not really talked about or known in terms of climate change.

I learned a lot about animal agriculture from the film “Cowspiracy.” I didn’t realize how serious the issue of animal agriculture was before. It was pretty disconcerting to see all the environmental organizations refuse to speak to Anderson about the issues of animal agriculture since Anderson was claiming that around half of greenhouse gas emissions were from animal agriculture. I did later learn from Professor Hiltner’s video that animal agriculture accounts for closer to 15% of total greenhouse gas emissions. This does make me question the credibility of Anderson’s points and the film overall. 
           <br><br>
From the film I was sad to learn that there are many activists that are killed for their work against the animal agriculture industry. One line that really stood out to me from the film was that “you can’t call yourself an environmentalist and eat meat, period. As someone that still has not cut meat out of their diet, but wants to take part in improving the environment, I feel like this line was directed directly at me. This line clearly tells me what I should start doing right now first and foremost if I want to be an environmentalist.

I also did not realize the extent to how much animal agriculture contributed to the climate crisis. When I first saw the title of this, I thought, “How is there going to be a whole 90-minute film on cows/cattle?” Needless to say, I was so surprised at the information with what I was presented. Since the information that Anderson presented to us may be false, I would not believe his data verbatim, but I was nonetheless shocked by the silence of environmentalist organizations. Environmentalist organizations have put economic support by animal agriculture in front of what they are essentially fighting for. I understand that some organizations want to avoid lawsuits, but essentially, misinformation is being spread since the goals of environmentalist organizations is to save the planet. It is difficult to save the planet if you are not addressing one of the largest contributors to the degradation of the planet. It is also scary to see how much of a hold corporations and profits hold over the world. There are lawsuits, but in extreme cases, people are being murdered for addressing corporations who are destroying the planet. It is also scary to see that governments are in on supporting corporations rather than the planets and other human beings.  It again reaffirms my belief that money has a big say on mostly everything in the world.
 
           <br><br>

Though the film was interesting, I was very disappointed to find out that Anderson presented us with incorrect data, such as the amount of carbon that animal agriculture produces. It completely undercut his arguments that he was attempting to make throughout the film. I also now wonder if the other data he presented in the film was actually accurate. Nonetheless, I still believe that food consumption and animal agriculture largely impact the climate crisis, as the professor stated that wasting less food is at #2 in project rundown and switching to a plant-based diet is at #3. I think that freeganism is actually a very impactful consumption alternative in regards to the climate crisis. As the professor mentioned, ⅓ to ½ of food produce is wasted; therefore, ⅓ to ½ of the environmental impact that food production has on the environment has on the planet is wasted. Hypothetically, humans are wasting up to 2x more resources on food production, and up to half of the impact of food production can be immediately cut if food was simply not wasted.

Growing up in China, I am told by teachers and my parents of the stories of the time when China had limited food supply and how I should always finish my foods that I don’t feel guilty. This has been my code of mine. But after I moved to the US, I have been struggling to keep it. It's not that I just started wasting food after I came to this county, there have been rare times that I would leave the food that I don’t like or cannot finish because I’m full, its the cultural shock that made food-wasting much more prominent in my life.
           <br><br>

I live in Tropicana del Norte, one of the off-campus dorm locations. At my dorm the cafe is right downstairs of my room, I like this arrangement very much. But being an exclusive cafe for our dorm, the food choice is limited, and I don’t have access to the bigger dining commons on campus. This has been a problem for quite a while. Last quarter, I usually just go for the made to order cheeseburger and fries, since this is higher quality than the other food that are precooked. But eating beef is very water-consuming, let alone the weight that I gained, so I went for the salad for a week or two. Deep down, I always prefer cooked vegetables rather than raw leaves with some dressing. So I tried the entrees that are cooked in batches for a week or so. Most of the time I end up wasting half of the food I took. My solution to this is very simple: eating out. Also, sometimes I get Korean ramen off of amazon and cook it in the microwave.
           <br><br>

I think the condition with my eating habits is not entirely my fault. From an environmental stand point, the best choices I made was eating salad every day. I did not waste any food, in fact I ate very little, and it was good on our planet. But that week was miserable, and I am certainly missing some proteins and vitamins from my diet. I believe my dorm’s cafe could do better. Some days they make fantastic food, but 80% of the time its okay food and people waste some of it. 
           <br><br>

That is my experience on food waste.

Welp I guess it’s time to go vegan. Or at least make my best effort at it. I’ve always known of the disastrous effects that cattle farming had on the environment thanks to the conversations sparked by documentaries like cowspiracy. However, I was always to selfish and lazy to make the switch to a plant based diet. Although up until now I’ve really had little say on what my parents bought at the supermarket. Meat being a staple food product in my family’s diet made it particularly difficult. But I think enough is enough. I am an adult now who can make his own dietary restrictions and it’s time to do what’s ethical for the planet. One of the things I found interesting from the documentary was how the notion of agribusiness being the leading cause in CO2 emissions was largely taboo to talk about. Even the suppose progressive groups who are lead the fight against the climate crisis refused to talk such a glaring problem in our societies. You know ever since I was a kid it seemed as though everyone knew that meat consumption and animal agriculture was terrible for the environment. It’s just so weird to see a time where something that isn’t particularity controversial today to be something that people were incompetent with. I guess it just goes to show how powerful the agriculture business is. It is really a shame that they can have so much power in places in Brazil where they can just off people with no repercussions. We don’t live in equal society when someone can have more power and influence than others. What’s worse is that this inequality has infested our political system. I think what really pushed me over edge into trying veganism was the duck killing. I couldn’t even watch the guy butcher the duck let alone do it myself. It really puts in perspective where are food comes from and if I wouldn’t do myself then I wouldn’t want anyone else doing it. And I understand that veganism is more than just a diet but a lifestyle but I’m gonna stick with the diet thing for now and see where I can go from there.

I really enjoyed the film “Wasted” because it's a solution that people can incorporate in their daily lives to address such a large issue as controlling our food production to alleviate the amount wasted. Creating great meals out of items that would normally be considered scraps and tossed out saves everyone money and the planet’s resources. I think part of the problem with food waste is how disconnected people are with their relationship to food such as where it comes from and how to execute tasty meals. Having renowned chefs like Anthony Bourdain converting ingredients that regular people would consider trash is inspiring and helps us think about how efficiently we’re actually using our resources.

Before this week, I had watched Cowspiracy twice; once in school when I was probably in 9th or 10th grade, and once on my own accord. This film was actually what turned me to becoming vegetarian (despite my parents’ complete lack of support in my choice), and I hope it did the same for many of those who watched it for the first time. 
            <br><br>

We already should be stopping (or at least drastically reducing) our meat consumption for the sake of being humane towards animals of ALL kinds. On top of that, we should stop the consumption of meat for the sake of our earth’s survival. Ruminants (cows, sheep, goats, deer…) have a “rumen” in their digestive system, which has microbes that allow the breakdown of cellulose. In the process of this breakdown, methanogenic microbes convert some of the carbon into methane (CH4). Methane, as we know, creates about 25x more global warming per molecule compared to CO2. Ruminant methane is the LARGEST single contributor to the nearly 25% of total emissions that come (directly and indirectly) from global agriculture. Meaning that if we stopped eating meat, even just ruminant meat, our agricultural practices would contribute far less to global warming. 
            <br><br>

While most countries around the globe do not have such a meat-heavy (especially beef-heavy) diet as the United States, it would still be difficult to convince people to change their food consumption habits without incentivizing the change. Therefore, I think we should find ways to make it more expensive and/or less convenient to eat meat than to go without it. For example, putting a tax on beef. This would decrease the number of people who can afford it or who are willing to pay for it, thus lowering the overall demand and forcing the supply to decrease. This would not only avoid the emission of methane by an excessive number of farmed ruminant animals, but would also decrease the amount of food necessary to feed livestock, which could instead go directly to humans. 
            <br><br>

If we can make it less convenient and more expensive to be eating meat, then meat consumption will SURELY decrease drastically. I also think more awareness needs to be brought to the issue; while people will make their own choices regardless, I believe everyone should see and understand how animal agriculture works, how inhumane it really is, and how environmentally catastrophic it may be.

After watching “Cowspiracy” I reflected on how I contribute to this problem. I realized how much food I waste at times, especially when I go out to eat at a restaurant with my family. At times I get full easily and waste around ⅓ of food due to their large portions. Food waste is very concerning as its not just me who participates in this. I witness this every single day in our very own dining commons. Tons of food are wasted every single day and it is very alarming after seeing the film and professor Ken’s video. From the film itself it concerned me how much it takes to produce a gallon of milk. The film states that, “a gallon of milk takes 1000 gallons of water to produce.” Not too long ago I went back home for the weekend and left behind around ⅛ of a gallon of milk behind which expired when I returned and had to throw out. Never have I thought about the implications this has for the environment. It takes tons of resources just to produce our food, and to just throw it away is an insult to our planet. It made me aware of how I must change these habits in my life. I also found it concerning how much of my food source is made up of meat. Whether it’s beef, chicken, pork, etc. it makes up my meals for every day of the week. Eating meat is a great part of my life and it would cost me  a lot to change my diet. Although, I’ve thought about cutting back on how much I consume meat; now after seeing this film I may give it a try and start with a day or two a week without meat. Cutting off meat at least for a day is a huge help to the environment, especially since the average american eats about 209 pounds of it yearly.

The effect the agribusiness has on the environment is devasting.
In the film “Cowspiracy” the main host stated numerous times that cows cause
50% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the globe, but Ken clarified in this
video that it is actually closer to 15%. I think this undercut him and for me
it personally harmed his credibility in the film. In my head during the entire film,
I felt as if a major conspiracy was going to be uncovered and I was intrigued
to see why these environmental organizations weren’t discussing the effects cattle
have on the environment. The environmental agencies were speaking out against fossil
fuel usage, even though cutting out the meat and dairy industries would have a much
larger impact. I think the American diet is holding back the United States from
living a more ecologically friendly lifestyle.

 I had always heard a lot about the film "Cowspiracy" but never actually watched it until now. I agree with your comment, it is quite disappointing that after all the hype I have heard about it over the years that a MAJOR and important statistic was so far from the truth. I also agree that is does make the film lose some of its credibility and makes me wonder if all the other facts that are stated in the film are true? The film states that it takes 660 gallons of water to produce 1/4 pound of beef but upon my own research, I found it to be closer to 450 gallons of water, which is still a lot of water, but in the big picture that is a drastic difference. Im curious where these facts from the film are coming from and if its a credible source. I also agree with the fact that the American diet does make it hard to eat more plant based and less meat, hopefully in the near future that will change since I am a meat eater myself out of convenience.

After watching the film, Cowspiracy. I found all the silence and responses from different climate change organizations very disturbing. Especially Bruce Hamilton’s response of “Oh, What about it…” when asked about animal agriculture. Hamilton began to delegate the issue of agribusiness to burning fossil fuels, which is very disturbing in a way that he seems to not care about agribusiness. Although, the film is called “Cowspiracy” because it is intended to show the undervalued information of raising livestocks and how it is the leading cause of carbon emission. If you do your research, there is truth to what the speaker is saying. The analogy of one quarter pounder of beef burger is the equivalent of 660 gallons of water, which is the same amount of 2 months showering. Furthermore, if you put that in play, like the example from the film. It really seems like you're allowing your own faucet to drip the whole street from your own household. Additionally, I am quite irritated from the findings of this film regarding the fish industry, especially on the research site in which the speaker found that the best way to help fish is to eat fish. I have no other response regarding the issue but “WTF”. How does that make sense?. As illustrated by one of the guest speakers in the film, He compared Fish consumption and industry to the “living of interest”. Clearly, he is basing the whole fishing industry on capitalism and economic purposes, the fact that he is comparing it to ‘interest’ and the idea of ‘principle’ value. Overall, the film’s findings and interviews with these ‘respectable’ organizations fighting the climate crisis is why I have trust issues and which is why the concept of climate crisis should be reevaluated by our society.

The purpose of the film is to bring awareness of an important issue that the general public does not know it was an issue to begin with. Like myself, I thought that the fossil fuel industries were the main contributors to the greenhouse gases but when watching the film, I was surprised to see that in fact the agricultural and livestock industry were actually the ones to blame. Then the question arose of, how come every website discussing climate change declares that climate change is caused by large fossil fuel companies? This question is the main premise of the film, trying to discover why the information being fed to the public is misleading to the reality of the situation. 
            <br><br>
The way in which the film was structured is very effective because the audience is introduced to an issue which affects them personally because like the general public we were lied to about the primary conductor driving the world to extinction, that being the agricultural industry rather than the fossil fuel industry as we have been told this entire time. Therefore the audience wants to dig in deeper to understand the reasons for this misinformation and that is exactly what the film provides. The film captures the journey of the narrator going to interview representatives of climate change organizations to ask the difficult questions that these organizations have been avoiding. 
            <br><br>
 During one of the interviews, the idea that all these well known organizations were companies at the end of the day. Therefore it would be “bad for business” if they were to address the agriculture and livestock as one of the main contributors to greenhouses gases because the public is directly tied with these industries. If organizations were to publish anything of the matter the public would feel offended because the blame for the climate crisis is put onto them (aka us) as it should be. However, people don't appreciate it whenever they are accused of doing something wrong because they feel attacked in their way of life. Therefore, these organizations don't address the issue because they are going to feel the repercussions through the means of their economic support (donations of those who support their purpose). However, when does an organization start to be money driven rather than purpose driven? 
            <br><br>
 When organizations are converted to what they shouldn't be, that is where their priority becomes misconstrued and even lost. This is a dangerous situation to be in as an advocate for these organizations that switched into being a company because the supporter wants to know what is actually happening and the reason for why these things are happening but they aren't given that. They don't even have a say in the matter because these companies refuse to say the truth although the main reason for their existence was to educate the public about the climate crisis. The issue is ironic but it speaks volumes about the U.S capitalism. 
            <br><br>
 It seems as though money is an incentive for people to be corrupted, so what does that say about the U.S who is one of the wealthiest nations in the world?

I was also super surprised about just how much livestock contributes to climate change. Well, I guess surprised would be the wrong word because it was more of a wake-up call. I already knew that raising and eating livestock contributed to climate change, but to see it broken down into statistics the way the creator did was crazy to me. He definitely does an amazing job of getting the audience to really see how manipulative these corporations are truly being. I found it funny every time a companies’ president or CEO didn’t want to comment on something or “didn’t know” the answer. There’s no way you’re the head of this company and have no idea what impacts the agriculture industry have on the environment, especially in terms of your own business. It’s 100% them feeling that it’s bad for business.

            <br><br>

People are definitely offended when the conversation of eating less meat gets brought up. My environmental science teacher in high school taught us the basics of climate change and told us how cows produce methane and what not. A classmate asked her if she would go vegan then, and her response was practically an entire rant about how eating meat is a part of American culture and she doesn’t think she could ever give up her beef. She even said she sees why people hate alternatives because “it just doesn’t taste like genuine meat!” She’s obviously not the only person that feels that way. With that being said, it’s very easy to see why corporations are quick to say “nope it’s fossil fuels” because that’s not directly targeting anyone’s personal lifestyle choices in most people’s eyes. But if you tell them to cut back on beef? It’s gameover.

<p>
I’ve known about the amount of greenhouse gases that come out of the meat industry, but I haven’t heard of the ocean pollution or the amount of water used per pound of beef. It was also kind of scary to see the amount of sway meat producers have politically. I’ve always known it is a lot, but not to the point that they could silence every green organization. This makes them more powerful than the massive oil industry that everyone harps on about. It was also shocking to see that the meat producers in Brazil were able to kill off over 1000 activists with no repercussions. It might as well be called the meat cartel with that kind of power.

Having already seen Cowspiracy, I resorted to watching Wasted. After watching such an impactful documentary, I was upset that the film was not required, or listed as #1 in videos for week 6. Cowspiracy, is a great film that gives light to some of the hypocrisy in environmental organizations and the detrimental impacts of the agriculture industry. However, the topic of food waste is not prevalent in environmental discourse throughout the general public. Although the concept of food being wasted is obviously problematic, many people are unaware of why throwing away food in the landfill is harmful to the environment. Working for a compost company, many of my peers and adults come to me with questions about how compost is beneficial to the Earth. As the film explained, there are various reasons as to why, many of which are unknown to the general public. Compost should be widely accepted throughout cities in the United States via legislation like Paris and Korea. Not only would this fight greenhouse gas emissions, it would also aid the city’s economy as compost can be a great resource for renewable energy and aid the state’s agriculture field. Many Americans are blind to the amount of food they waste as grocery stores attach expiration labels that are not always true to the edible food. For these reasons, and many more, we are in desperate need of a cultural change over how we buy, eat, and waste our food.

Many Americans do waste food because of the best-used dates and I understand why they would be scared to eat the food after the recommended dates to eat the food. I think they don’t understand the difference between best-used and expiration dates because most food products have the best-used phrasing while some have an expiration date. Since they seem to have almost the same meaning, people associate those two phrases together and whenever they see one of them, they associate with the other and think that it is no longer good to eat. When I was younger, I always thought that bread has to be finished before the best-used dates and if I didn’t finish it on that exact day, the bread will go bad and will give me a stomachache right away. I think it’s because of how the food industry portrays those dates because if they get people to throw food away when the food is perfectly normal, they will get more revenue since people would go back to the store to get more of the same product when the product at home is still eatable. I didn’t realize this until later on and I feel guilty about the food I wasted when I was younger when there are millions of people across the world that are currently starving. Also, when I was watching the film, I thought it was crazy that the food we grow for cows is enough to feed the whole world but we aren’t feeding people who are malnourished in order to profit from people who would pay more for beef.

Food waste is actually a big problem that people should really pay attention to. First of all, why should people ‘waste’ stuff? Secondly, not everyone knows what impact will occur when food are waste. This impact may not directly impact themselves, but it impacts the Earth and gradually people’s lives will be impacted. Food waste appears everywhere. Food waste in kindergarten and primary school are not that much now compare to it was in the past because more education have achieve the goal. However, waste food appears in the process of production. Waste food appears in many restaurant (adults are harder to persuade). Waste food appears in the farms. Those accumulations will lead to huge problems.

Many of the facts mentioned in the film "Cowspiracy" were pretty crazy. They were definitely enough to make me consider straying away from beef products. I was previously aware that the beef industry was a large contributor of greenhouse gases, but I had no idea to what extent. Hopefully, it will help convince others that avoiding beef products is the right thing to do. The film could have been better, as many of the facts mentioned were exaggerated, which would undercut its purpose for me, but fossil fuel companies have been giving false information for a very long time, and it is obviously working out for them. The false information provided in this did not affect my opinion on the situation personally, as I believe the true facts are enough, they may give many people an excuse to throw the whole argument away. I understand that the filmmakers wanted to capture the attention of the audience, but I believe that there are better ways to do this. The film was enough for me to change my eating habits, and with luck, it will spark change for many others as well.

From watching this film, I learned that a problem with bringing up concerns about animal agriculture is that many people’s efforts are shut down. The animal agriculture industry holds a lot of power. It was bizarre to see that representatives of many environmental organizations stayed in silence when asked about the topic. It is true, that the organizations are businesses that look for funding from their supporters. The idea of being “anti-meat” would harm their project. I was shocked by the fact that 1,100 activists have been killed in Brazil over the last 20 years for speaking up, this is insane! This movement does require “behavior change”, which I believe is possible. If we have already changed our sources of electricity and water use, I believe a plant-based diet is a goal that we could reach. I just think our society needs to be exposed to this kind of information and given steps to join the movement. Besides all the facts collected in the film, I think they did a good job in showing the opinions of those who have already contributed to the movement. Their certainty that the change of our diet can have a huge impact on our environment was inspiring.

I agree with you a hundred percent on what the video taught me about how much power that the upper dogs of the agricultural industry have in the information we get. Its amazing how much the public doesn't know about the issue at hand. I think that beef consumption and production would drastically fall if the entire public knew about what was going on. This is similar to the tobacco industry 40 to 50 years ago when they tried to cover up the issues that were proven to be caused by cigarettes. I think that for the issue to begin to start to be resolved, those who are in power politically need to take action.

I really enjoyed the movie Cowspiracy. I’m already vegan, so there wasn’t a lot of new information, but I really liked how simply it put the argument together. I also really liked the section on how veganism can put the values back into our food system and increase our compassion. I feel like a future in which we value every animals’ life is probably less violent and more ecologically healthy than one where we exploit animals. I was disappointed that the numbers he had were wrong, especially because I feel like it may lead a lot of people (like in this class) to brush aside all of his arguments based on that.
            <br><br>

To me, it just makes sense land-use wise as well to switch to a fully vegan diet. It takes so much more land and work to produce a pound of meat than a pound of plants. Right now, it’s mainly the wealthiest people who are eating a lot of meat, like Americans, but if that trend continues to the rest of the developing world, we simply won’t have enough land to sustain that. It seems to make the most sense to switch now. There are already a lot of vegan substitutes on the market, so I think people are starting to realize the environmental and health impacts of animal products. My experience has been that once you make the switch, it becomes easier and you just keep getting more reasons to keep doing it.

I have seen both of these films in the past, and found both very interesting and life changing. And I owe cowspiracy for making me switch to a mostly vegan diet and a full vegetarian diet. Nobody, even many environmental organizations, wants to talk about the impact that animal agriculture has on the environment, and the fact that it is the leader in causing deforestation, water consumption, and pollution. Not to mention the destruction of the rainforest, habitat loss, topsoil erosion, extinction of many species, creating dead zones in the ocean, and many other destructive environmental impacts. But yet this is something that is kept hush, and nobody is trying to challenge it, until this film. The meat industry and animal agriculture has so much power in today's world, and money to keep control of this power, which is the driving force for many corporations for keeping quiet about how destructive they are to the environment, they rather not educate one on the problem of industrial agriculture, and say things like reduce your shower time, or drive less, when in fact one would help the environment even more if they cut out meat or just simply reduced their meat intake. This switch does not have to be as scary as everyone makes it out to be, one can just simply start with meatless mondays, and gradually cut it out, or just reduce how many times they eat meat in a week; every little bit helps. If enough people switch to a more plant based diet, we can take the power away from the animal agriculture industry, and give it back to the environment. 
            <br><br>

I have seen Wasted multiple times just like Cowspiracy, and Ken touches on the fact that we waste so much food, and it may be better to be a freegan than a vegan. But this lifestyle is not for everyone for it involves eating discarded food, which could include dumpster diving. This is important tho, because so much food is thrown out by industries, but could be less intimidating and seen as gross if these local industries just were in contact with local freegans to distribute the products they were going to throw out and waste. This seems much more doable, and does not turn one's stomach as much as going out and seeking their own discarded food. In order to save this planet our society needs to switch our view towards food, and food consumption, through simple and small changes. Making food changes is very easy, and many are scared to make the change due to societal pressures, but if we change this view, make it more accessible for all, the switch to a more plant based and freegan society is very much so doable.

This is the first thing I immediately came up with after watching Cowspiracy. The URL above links to a site called The Meatrix, which is an ironic and dark-style animation portraying the reality of modern industrial farming. Same intro plot as The Matrix, it is showing how an awaken pig discovered its true fate and the ugly conspiracy behind mass animal production. 
            <br><br>


To be honest, this little snippet adds exaggeration on the harsh sides of farming, but when I watched Cowspiracy and saw how they treat milk cows in one of the dairy factories, I literally started to shiver. Thousands of poor milk cows squeezed in, the milking space with huge machines is just like the infernal. They eat, drink, get milked, and continue eating. “There is no such thing as sustainability,..., The priority is profitability.” said the owner. Here, cows are treated as commodities, not to mention animal well-being. Apart from the environment, there is one word that also alarmed me. “Cow milk is baby-calf growth fluid...It is to turn a calf to cow rapidly as possible.” I never think in this way before. I definitely know all milk is for baby. But I just let it slip away that what is actually in milk, or is it really beneficial for human to drink that? After hearing the vegan environmentalist’s description, I really feel gross and at least in short run milk will not be in my fridge.

I think this film has tremendous potential to be very impactful, a great deal of which is squandered once the inaccuracy of the facts in the film is revealed. I have been vegan for over a year now and have been very eager to see what Cowspiracy had to say about the changes that veganism can bring to the environment as well as consumer health, but the drastic difference in the figures used in the movie and those that were based in fact is significant enough that I think it should make us as viewers largely skeptical of the film’s claims. I think this is very unfortunate, as a lot of important information is spread by viewing this video, but how much of it is actually true? How can we expect the consumer to trust in the potential of a plant based lifestyle if we feel the need to blatantly deceive and lie to people in order to meet that end?

I have watched both Cowspiracy and Wasted, however after reflecting on both, I would have to say I think Peter Calmus’ take on the food waste issue is more effective. Although he is hyperbolic about the extent of the issue, he nevertheless implants that it is an issue worth caring about into the minds of people who matter. He interacts with people of the beef industry and people who claim to be climate change solvers. He exposes the people that call themselves experts in the field of climate change by showing the audience that they do not rank animal agriculture high enough on the list of chief contributors. It is in their minds not a big deal. Although Calmus overhypes its effect, it is still a contributor worth trying to fix. I think his overhyping of animal agriculture really got to these “experts”  and made them step back to rethink the ways to solve climate change by attacking major sources. Now more focus is on animal agriculture, more than it would have gotten otherwise. People mostly take vegan diets or plant based diets for maybe fitness and weight loss goals, however, the true benefit of this dietary change is not in our own physical appearance, but in the state of our home, earth. I was inspired to eat less beef from a documentary called Food Inc. which exposes animal agriculture for the harsh conditions and unhealthy injections that we intake. I made my dietary change based on selfish reason, but now, I am truly going to really try to commit to a plant based diet now that I am aware of how harmful the animal agriculture industry is to not just animals or our bodies, but our planet.

It’s incredibly shocking how even though the livestock agricultural system is not only responsible for 15% of our carbon emissions, but is also responsible for mass deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution, etc. and it is not talked about as a major issue compared to problems like plastic straws or big oil companies. I don’t think that the narrator of the documentary getting a fact wrong should discredit his argument/documentary as a whole because it is still an incredibly important topic to bring attention to. The concept of a "freegan" is very interesting to me because there has always been a sort of negative connotation to “dumpster diving” or eating almost expired or damaged food but in reality, the people who do are in a way saving our planet and lowering the amount of food waste the general public and grocery stores produce. I hope that with more films like “Cowspiracy,” and articles like “Project Drawdown” more people can become aware of how much their individual choices and habits can harm the environment.

<p>
The film "Wasted!" was a well structured film that I enjoyed and learned a lot from. The film introduced the problem of food waste, as well as solutions and demonstrated the people that do their part. With the food waste pyramid there is "feed the people", livestock, energy, compost, and landfill. It stated "In the U.S 40% of the food we produce goes to waste" and at first I did not understand how food waste was connected to the climate crisis but apparently when we send food waste to landfills it produces methane (which is 23% more dangerous than carbon dioxide). What shocked me was the fact that a lettuce takes 25 years to decompose in landfills and in the U.S 19% of our food waste goes to to the landfills. Whereas in Korea, they have implemented a food waste system that charges the citizens by the amount of food waste they throw away and with this action their food waste has decreased 30%. 
            <br><br>
First the food should "feed the people" and what I found the most interesting was a grocery store called Daily Table; which is a grocery store that sells vegetables, and fruit and other healthy options for cheap price as they are competing with the prices of fast food. I found this store to be such an amazing idea, because I know that when I go to target or Albertsons they charge so much for the healthier foods, and its ridiculous. On top of that, it's a lot healthier for the community to go to the Daily table rather than a McDonalds and feeding their children bad food. The best part of this store is that they use the vegetables and fruits that they can't sell to make dishes of their own to sell to the customers who do not feel like cooking that day. It's amazing and I wish we had a Daily Table everywhere on the world and maybe then people would change their diet. 
            <br><br>
Lastly, the fact of teaching kids to garden their own food makes them want to eat the fruit and vegetable they garden and on top of that they learn about not wasting food as they worked hard to get it. Towards the end it was said: "you don't just change a child, you change a family, which changes the community, which changes the city, enough cities can change the nation and a nation can change the planet." It all starts with us.




</p><hr>


<p>
To start off, I'm all for reducing or even eliminating my meat consumption to reduce my carbon footprint. And it's a healthier diet too! But while I was watching Cowspiracy, I feel like Kip's pride and passion for the subject matter got in the way of presenting a completely honest film statistically speaking. I noticed that he was very proactive in taking charge over the matter, but the facts that he stated sometimes were not explained thoroughly, such as when he was talking to the two men about energy usage and eating less meat. Saying things like a beef patty uses one thousand gallons of water is shocking but hard to contemplate without context. While I know now after this class how that may calculate out, for the casual viewer I don't see how they're expected to know. Given context and a thorough explanation, I think Kip would've communicated the facts much better because they are shocking but honestly hard to believe given one doesn't know much about animal agriculture and the small gain created with such a detrimental loss.
            <br><br>

I do what I can to be environmentally friendly (shopping second-hand, reducing meat consumption, no food waste, etc.), but I think that there were moments in the film when I questioned how much Kip would do. I appreciate his passion, but criticizing certain groups and placing them in inferiority, as if they didn't care about climate change at all seemed a little wrong to me. It makes sense to me why certain people in the government would be hesitant to make an opinionated statement on eating less meat and veganism in general on film(!) because it would affect how our country and society functions as a whole. Overall, I think the film did a good job at communicating how harsh animal agriculture is to the environment however. While Kip may have been aggressive, he was fighting for a good cause.




</p><hr>


<p>
At the beginning of the film I thought it would be a pointless search for Cowspiracy star, Kip Anderson, to look for environmental organizations that would ignore the fact that agribusinesses has such a large carbon footprint, but as the film progressed there were many who didn't want to speak on the topic. After realizing what a massive industry agriculture was, I was able to understand why maybe these organizations were hesitant to speak up against the issue. It is terrifying that no one wants to talk about it because of the dominant position the agriculture business is in, and the lengths they are willing to go in order to preserve the industry. The many deaths of Brazilian activists who were killed for speaking out against the deforestation for cattle farms was an astonishing and terrifying fact that really put the issue of environmental groups not speaking on the issue into perspective. 

            <br><br>

Changing our food patterns to a dominantly plant based diet will have to be a reality around the globe soon. The fact that the food production we are consuming today will not be able to provide for our growing population is a hard pill to swallow, but an unfortunate reality we will have to face. The switch to electric energy and limiting Co2 emissions will take up to 20 years to accomplish. Limiting methane production by switching to a vegan diet is the best course of action for an environmental activist because it is an action that has so many benefits and can start today. In addition to the small time it takes a person to start doing, it will limit all of the bad things on top of methane production that cattle ranches produces, such as, deforestation, top soil erosion, ocean dead zones, species extinction, etc. Cowspiracy taught me that a plant based diet is not only more ethical but absolutely necessary in order to save our planet.

Watching the film Cowspiracy was very interesting through Kip Andersen’s journey to figure out the truth of the livestock’s industry contributions to the Climate Crisis. At first, I found it strange that major environmental groups were remaining silent on the livestock's negative impact on the planet, but later was scared to realize that probably the majority of them were silent because of the fear of being threatened or killed. As mentioned in the film, over 1,100 activists had been killed in the last 20 years in Brazil for speaking up about how cutting down the Amazon rainforest for livestock is detrimental to the environment. Just imagine that you’re a person trying to speak up for what is right, but later get killed for it? It was a risk for Andersen to produce this film and all of the people interviewed and involved because the truth is being known and big corporations do not want this to happen and will put an end to those who speak up. It creates a wave of fear into people because they do not want to say anything that could cost their lives or future. I find it important that he went to go interview all of these different organizations and even visited some of the farms where the animal products are produced because it shows his audience that this is actually happening. Another good reason for this is to show that the information that he provided was not just coming from him and that he sought out people who are experts in their respected areas to educate us, fill in any gaps, and clarify anything. Every paper, film, or book needs outside sources because it makes you less credible if you’re just speaking for yourself (depending on the topic,) unless you’re of course an expert in your area. Even though including credible outside sources is better than none. 

            <br><br>

As I have mentioned in a previous comment, I have gone vegan and so I am looking for alternatives to the food that I used to eat. I am thrilled to see that there are companies today that are working to create plant-based foods such as Josh Tetrick’s Beyond Eggs, John Schindler’s Omega Creamery, and Ethan Brown’s Beyond Meat. I have already tried beyond meat burgers and I can vouch that these are extremely good and taste just like a regular burger. We need to continue to experiment with other alternatives because it is the only way we are going to save the planet in terms of the way we consume food.
            <br><br>


I find it so mind-boggling how much water is needed to produce the food we eat. According to the film, 1 gallon of milk requires 1000 gallons of water and 2500 gallons of water are needed for one pound of beef. That’s crazy! Do you know much of that water could be given to places around the world they do not even have access to clean water? It makes me sad knowing that the food production of animal products uses so much of the planet’s resources, yet there is not nearly as much effort as there should be to change the way we look at food. It has to start now because if no one is going to lead the cause, then people will have no one to follow unless of course you become the leader and take initiative.

With regards to your second section, I am responding as someone who has not cut meat out of their diet and eats A LOT of food. I am what lots of people would call a “gym rat” and would say that I generally eat about 4000-4500 calories a day. While I fully acknowledge that eating animal based proteins such as meat, cheese and eggs, is unsustainable, it is difficult for me to find alternatives that I can afford. 
            <br><br>
I have the ability to go to Costco and get 5 dozen eggs and a large bag of frozen chicken breasts that will last me about 2 weeks, for roughly $22. Alternatively, if i wanted to use the meat substitutes such as the impossible burger or other plant based meat substitutes, it would cost me a small fortune to eat. I don't want to discredit the argument that my eating habits in caloric quantity and thus gym habits are unsustainable, because they probably are. But I do believe that there is a strong argument to be made that these plant based substitutes simply not being accessible to everyone.

Watching Cowspiracy, I was astonished to see how uncooperative the so-called environmentalist groups were. It appears to me that they have adopted the same culture that they claim to abhor about the corporate world. For the head of the Sierra Club to be presented with a legitimate study about the severity of animal agriculture emissions and then just brush it off as a different point of view is reminiscent of how climate-crisis deniers respond to the same studies. As a whole, it is really crazy to learn how awful animal agriculture is for not only the atmosphere, but for the ocean as well. In all honesty I had never really considered an entirely vegetarian diet but after watching Cowspiracy I am having a change of heart.

My reaction was similar to yours, the way these groups sort of deflected from what was presented to them was kind of annoying. Overall this documentary was very informative to me but it left me wondering how are things going to change when industries control the narrative and the production. I guess it is on the consumer's shoulders to bring about change, but like one of the guys said it is hard to instill behavioral change amongst the masses. Especially something as big as going vegetarian.

After watching “Cowspiracy” I felt that, once again, it all comes down to money; these businesses that claim they fight for the betterment of our environment refuse to address the issue of the detriment of the agribusiness because they rely on funding and don’t want to support something to put them at risk of not receiving that, even though animal agriculture is one of the leading sources of the climate crisis. The environmental organizations refuse to act even though the information is right before their eyes.
            <br><br>
On another note, this film provided a multitude of facts relating to how our diet impacts the climate. No form of fishing is sustainable and as said in the film, fish is not a sustainable form of protein in general. “If our oceans die, we die.” Our society needs to come to terms with the fact that, first of all, our government is spewing out misinformation, and second of all, our diet-related decisions are the most impactful individual decisions that can help save our climate. 100 species a day are lost due to rainforest destruction. This rainforest destruction is cleared for cattle grazing and soy production. It is a cycle of climate destruction. The forests are cleared causing a depletion of biodiversity and then that land is used for cattle and GMOs that produce harmful methane and waste. Along with that, harmful pesticides are used causing even more climate destruction as well as health detriment for those that work with the agribusiness and also those who consume genetically-modified products.
            <br><br>
“A lot of people that were speaking out got killed,” when talking about exposing the fact that cattle ranching is destroying the Amazon. This is a devastating reality to live in. The fact that people have lost their lives by exposing the truth that needs to be heard and the truth that will save our planet and ecosystems, is outright absurd. The lobbying power of the animal agriculture industry is stronger than I would have ever imagined; it is also terrifying that Congress and our government in general just sit by letting all of this destruction and corruption occur. 
            <br><br>
The film claimed that our planet would have, “fishless oceans by the year 2048.” The fact that “sustainable” fishing is not sustainable at all was also a shock. I didn’t know about bi-kill and the fact that so many other species are affected in the large net fishing process. It is devastating to see that there are no regulations or laws to protect the species in our ocean. Our ocean is such an important part of our ecosystem and environment and the more we continue to harm it with runoff chemicals and unsustainable fishing, the worse our climate is going to get. This is a human-eating-animals population issue. We must live as selfless beings because it is a necessity to keep our earth thriving and not just surviving.

I completely agree with you in terms of these issues being centered around money. Because clearly, they are. Businesses and those in power will do anything to make their money without thinking twice about the consequences this has on people, and the environment. Like you stated, no businesses is going to do what puts them in danger of not getting the money they want even if it's the ethical thing to do. When it reaches the level of people dying due to the exposing of these facts, this all becomes so devastating and infuriating. There are no rules or care by officials to fix these issues that are killing people, animals and the environment. 
            <br><br>
Another thing that really bothers me is the fact that food is based on appearance, and the way that if it does not look pretty or "normal" the businesses don't sell them or people assume they are gone bad. This contributes to the nonstop food waste issue that is so frustrating. Even restaurants refuse to give out food, and just toss it in the trash than see someone who really needs it have food. These issues on food are one of the most sad for me to hear because it leaves me feeling hopeless.
<br><hr>
From fracking and gasoline companies to the beef industry it seems like many companies are using their funding to keep environmental agencies at bay. I think this can again be linked to the fact that the climate crisis's consequences are felt decades later rather than in the moment which allows companies to get away with emitting tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In addition, meaty and dairy foods are customary to many American diets. Since the majority of people in America eat meat, it would be difficult to impose sudden regulations on meat production. Many people will protest which is why I believe the beef industry has gotten away with their environmental damages for so long.
            <br><br>


As you mentions, another reason why agriculture is so detrimental to our atmosphere is that it forces us to cut down trees in order to clear land for crops. With our population steadily rising and being expected to hit 9.8 billion people by 2050, a lot more surface area on the earth will need to be dedicated to growing crops to keep people fed. This has severe consequences on our ecosystem, wiping out animal species and reducing biodiversity altogether.

            <br><br>

I was looking through a biology textbook earlier today for one of my classes and found that 86 percent of all corn produced in the United States is genetically modified. that means that out of 7 corn cobs only 1 has been produced naturally. This was a huge shock to me because I always try to buy organic foods as I don't really trust GMO products and never would have imagined how much the market has taken over the United States economy. Now, GMO foods and plants are fed to cows which in turn release significantly more greenhouse gases and also affect us when we eat the cows who were exposed to genetically modified plants all their lives.
<br><hr>

I agree with your sentiment that it all comes down to money, but I also feel like that's sometimes more beneficial to do. Yes, I hate that environmental organizations are not speaking about the harms and failures of agriculture, but I also feel that keeping membership up makes these organizations a lot more effective. If an organization receives more donations or funding by not taking an adamant stance against agribusiness, I think it's overall more beneficial to the cause of saving the environment than only receiving funding from the incredibly small portion of the population that is ready to go fully plant-based. Many orgs who are staying quiet about this are probably non profits using that money to lobby in favor of other environmentalist issues. 
            <br><br>

Ultimately, I agreed with the plant based ideals expressed in Cowspiracy, but I feel that it's more veneficial for organizations to continue receiving donations and let people personally decide what to do about their own diets.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with your view after viewing "Cowspiracy". I feel that unless there is a realization by industry and government, the great change that must be taken will not be done as these entities hold the most power of our methods of consumption. It is corrupt and ignorant in how we consume and waste our planet's resources. We take it as a way of life and the growing prominence of meat and dairy industries are no help to fostering a chance for reflection in the "American way" of eating. I feel as though we are mindlessly consuming due to not only the lack of thought by each individual, but also at the consistent way our demands are met by companies. There seems to be an odd dichotomy of ideas, as we say we care of the environment, yet carelessly destroy land and waste energy and resources. We are a society that has gotten comfortable and greedy with our nature in producing food and eating it. There needs to not only be self-reflection but industry and government change in order for us to collectively and efficiently become knowledgeable and work together in remedying the destruction we have already caused.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with you, I was also horrified at the power of the animal agriculture industry. I knew that the oil and gas industry had a lot of power and so I assumed that they were the industry that was the worst for the planet. But at least people know that oil and gas are bad for the planet, even if many are not doing anything about it. Hardly anyone seems to know about how bad meat-rich diets are, including me before taking this class. After watching the film I'm shocked at the terrible impacts of the animal agriculture industry and how no one knows about it and no one will talk about it. It makes me sad how much power money has in this country. This documentary has also educated me and inspired me to make changes in my life. After taking this class I have already tried to limit the amount of meat I eat (three meals a week with meat max) but now I'm considering switching to a full vegetarian, or even vegan, diet.
<br><hr>

I was also shocked by the statistic that oceans may be fishless by the year 2048. I had always assumed that seafood was the more sustainable food source and I have been striving to include as much of it in my diet. I guess I had that belief because marine animals didn't take up space in the earth nor released methane like cows. The most challenging part now will be getting 3rd world countries to obey any real sustainable fishing laws as they don't have the economic prosperity to deny their citizens the largest source of their diet.

            <br><br>

It's amazing how so many of the crazy statistics, like this one, have been kept from the public's attention. I don't blame it on a conspiracy for say as I think that a lot of it is due to our willful ignorance of the way the world really works.

            <br><br>

Finally, I wanted to add that it is interesting that this is the first real non 'US led' ecological disaster since Americans aren't as big into fish as other countries. This really helped show me the disproportionate amount of environmental damage the US has done

I thought this film was very helpful as it showed me how much the problem of food waste is. I did not know that food waste was such a large problem, I mean I knew that it was a problem, but all the effects of food waste I did not know about. I’m amazed that people do not realize how stupid wasting food is, like if we just used this food for anything else it would help to save millions of dollars and even save lives as it could be used to feed the hungry. Wasting food just doesn’t seem logical to me, why wouldn’t the government want to set up composting programs or programs to help feed livestock since it could help save them so much money. I’m very glad that I watched this though because I stopped eating beef in part because of Cowspiracy and now I know I can help the planet even more by just reducing my food waste. I have definitely wasted way more food in my life than I should have, but I really want to make an effort now to reduce that waste as it causes so much harm. Furthermore, the innovative ways that people thought of to not waste food in this video was really cool and I really liked how the film approached this problem from the viewpoint of many different people but especially chefs. These chefs were taught not to waste food and therefore have very creative ideas to use every ingredient to its full potential. If more people had the mindset of these chefs, waste in general would go down as many people seem to undervalue products, and have a fixed view on their purpose instead of finding creative ways to reuse things. But it is like that one chef said, when you have limitless supplies creativity is not really needed or wanted and therefore, won’t be used.

From my perspective, this movie communicates the subject very well to the audiences. Throughout the film, Anderson establishes that animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation. By its definition, deforestation is the permanent destruction of numerous types of forests to make the land available for other uses. Besides the purposes that this movie conveys, I also believe that people’s wicked desire to harvest timber to create commercial items such as paper and furniture effectively causes deforestation. We need to create a balance between commerce and nature. Not only we fulfill our business needs, but we also should keep a moderate use of our environment. Nature provides everything for people. This movie’s audiences should be all casual viewers. Everyone ought to become an advocate for the experimentalist and support conservation organizations. The government might also need to implement a particular policy to improve the situation. I feel optimistic after watching this movie because I think that we can promote the development of change.

I found the film "Wasted" very interesting. Before watching the film, I was already concerned and acting on my food wastage. I am currently limited to they types of food I can eat (sometimes it physically hurts too much to finish whatever I bought or served myself.) When I first began to be limited on the food I could eat, I found myself serving myself too much food and having to throw it out. This made me feel very bad, so I started serving myself less and telling myself that I really needed to finish everything on my plate. This film has opened my eyes to so much more than that. There are so many other components into food waste than my own doings. I didn't really think of all the food that is being disposed by super markets and the other means. I was really shocked to learn just how much they are throwing out. I could really see how super markets use tactics to make us buy more as the film mentioned. A part of the film that sort of "slapped me in the face" was the part about the "best by" dates. I am very paranoid about those dates, and usually try to eat whatever I buy well before the dates on the item. 
            <br><br>
Another part of the film that stood out to me the most was the part about the garden education program. It was really nice to see the kids being enthusiastic about not throwing things out and feeding the soil instead. I just thought that was so important and wish I could have had something like that when I was in elementary school.

as a second year in college, I am becoming more familiar with food preparation, and all that comes along with it such as the grocery store trips. Interestingly enough, I recently found a loaf of bread at Albertsons that had already expired. I wondered where it goes when consumers don’t buy it off of the shelves, and it’s terrifying to know that it all gets tossed out. Imagining this on a global level is even worse. Personally, I try to think about how fortunate I am to have food on the table. However, it’s unlikely that we are able to consume all of the items in our kitchen by its expiration date. I still do think it’s important to track/monitor our diets and food expiration dates seeing as they highly contribute to this ongoing environmental crisis. If people are made aware of how significant their impacts are, then they can reverse the situation and work towards a better future for this generation and the ones after that.

Cowspiracy is an informative film that raises awareness of the true nature of animal agriculture and the meat and dairy industry. Societies increase in the consumption of goods is damaging our planet’s environment and hindering the amount of resources we have and our overall comfort for the future. As our population continues to quadruple Earth’s tipping point, our demands for goods and services increases eventually leading to the total stripping of resources. Prior to watching this film, I was already aware of the extremely negative effects that this particular industry has on the environment, but had personally not changed my own lifestyle. My inability to change along with others is the main reason why we have not seen tremendous progress. Individual and institutional attention to these issues will mean nothing if we do not take collective action against animal agriculture. Finding out that 1000 gallons of water is needed to produce 1 gallon of milk and 2500 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef made me want to quit eating these things all alone. After this documentary I made the executive decision to practice what I teach and if I truly want to make a difference I have to follow.

One scene that really stuck out to me in "Cowspiracy" was the scene where the duck-farmer had to butcher one of the ducks by chopping off it's head. That, right there, is one of the most powerful tools a person use to get the message across: some form of death or destruction. That scene reminded of a time when I was a little girl, going with my mom to get some chickens for dinner, and had to go inside the farm because she thought I was "too young" to stay in the car by myself. That day was one of the most traumatic moments of my life, when I saw all of those chickens and ducks squeezed into these tiny cages, feathers, blood, and feces everywhere, and the smell of fire and blood was distinct in that farm. I witnessed my mom picked two chickens that day and watching one of the butchers crack the neck of the chickens and skin it so that it was ready for us to cook. That day, I could not eat the soup that my mom tried to gave me, as I was sick to my stomach remembering that farm over and over again. I remember avoiding meat for a week because of that experience! Sadly, because of the family lifestyle and the cultural affects placed on me and my family, I never stopped eating meat.

            <br><br>

But thanks to "Cowspiracy", I was able to remind myself that I NEED to do my part and try to stray away from eating so much meat and wasting so much food. However, like how Ken stated in the video, it did annoy me that the narrator kept bringing up wrong facts or exaggerated facts to get the message across. I believe scenes like the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and the killing of animals is quiet enough for us to get the emotional message across. I do want to start avoiding meat because of this movie and Ken's video! Heck, when I learned that pigs produced heavy amounts of methane and is not at all good for your body, I heavily began to avoid pork. I think the biggest issue I will face is how in my culture, beef and chicken are in almost every dish made. Luckily though, thanks to the innovation of plant-based meats, I can start developing new substitutes for the meals that I have grown to love. If avoiding meat is one of the major ways for us to help our carbon footprint, then I want to be part of the fight and help as much as I can

For me, this movie brought back bad memories of when I first moved to California. Our first Christmas here, my family and I took a road trip from where we lived (Imperial Valley) all the way to Springfield. It was honestly a trip from hell, through the pits of fire, to Tartarus.  

            <br><br>

In the middle of the desert, we passed upon miles upon miles upon miles of farmland, as far as the horizon as the horizon could see. It was the most horrifyingly sterile sight. There were cabbages being grown in the white desert sand irrigated by these concrete canals carrying water all the way from the Colorado river. Up above it all, we could see two planes spraying what we assume to be pesticide for the giant desert bugs. In short, it was like a scene taken straight out of 1984 and truly put into perspective how much water farming takes and how much ecological damage farming does. That land was not meant to be farmland. Not even cacti grew there. I can only imagine how much water it took to convert and maintain the land. 
            <br><br>


Once out of the desert, we passed through the flats, where we saw the ungodly dairy farms and where I, out of shame and disgust closed my eyes for the majority of the ride. There were cows, worse than in the film, baking in the sun, all packed so tightly that even from up above, you could not see the ground between them. Most of them were so skinny, that they looked like they could topple over with a slight push. That was not the worst part however. That title is reserved for Springfield. Springfield and all its apocalyptic oil pumps. 
            <br><br>


All I can remember is looking as far as the eye can see and just seeing the oil pumps with the tubing running all over the floor. It was surreal. I felt as if I was in some sort of steampunk, apocalyptic, mad max universe. I couldn't help but wonder what would happen if one of those, exposed pipes broke. Additionally, the town itself was just bleak. Without going too much into detail, I can safely say it earned its title of most polluted town in America. 
            <br><br>


Overall this was my first exposure to the roots of all the comforts I enjoyed at the beach in San Diego. It was traumatic, horrifying and put me in a path that landed me in this class. There is nothing like facing the harsh reality to shock one back to the truth.

After watching Wasted, I came to realize how many different ways people can help reduce food waste. I thought it was clever that the filmmakers traveled to diverse parts of the world to document how different people in different places fought wasting food. One part of the film that made a big impact on me was how misleading best by/sell by dates are on grocery products. Growing up, my mom always told me to never eat or drink something that is past its due date, while my dad always did the "smell test" to see if it was okay to consume. I adopted my mom's strategy towards this issue because I always wanted to be safe rather than sorry, but watching this film makes me realize that perhaps the smell test method that my dad employs is better to implement, because it would encourage me to not waste as much food. It made me upset that several products have best by dates although these same products don't exactly go bad; I think it's ridiculous that water bottles have best-by dates. This made me wonder if these dates placed on products are just a tactic for food companies to sell products faster. The fact alone that so many people are misguided by these dates like me causes buyers to throw away perfectly good items because they're "overdue"; a simple fix regarding this issue would lead to far more people wasting less food because of an expiration date.

            <br><br>

Before watching this film I didn't understand composting but just knew it was something environmentally friendly. Now I know that composting is a win-win:  it reduces food waste and encourages people to eat food that they grow themselves from the food they would've instead thrown away! Composting is additionally environmentally beneficial because it supports the slow food movement. Being able to grow and eat your own food is better for the earth because it eliminates the greenhouse gas emissions required to transport "fast" food to grocery stores for example. Becoming someone who composts and eats their own food is a great way to help the environment, and educate people about good eating habits and cooking. I aspire to compost and grow my own food as an adult to combat food waste, and learn about gardening and healthy eating!

After watching "Cowspiracy" I was shocked and had many doubts. There were so many claims that seemed outrageous, I could not believe they were true without researching them myself, so that's exactly what I did. After finding out these claims were credible, I came across their website where they have all of these facts laid out for you to read. https://www.cowspiracy.com/facts One fact on here separate from the main issue of the land animal livestock problem that completely blew my mind was that by 2048 we could possibly see oceans without fish. We take up to 100 million tons of fish from the ocean every year. For every pound of fish caught, 5 pounds of unintended marine life are killed. This is ridiculous! 500 million tons of marine life, killed for no reason. I could go on listing and commenting on all of the facts on here but what really got me thinking is that none of this would be an issue or even in existence for that matter if we just ate plants. Aside from the ethical and environmental implications of eating meat, the health reasons alone should be enough for someone to switch to a plant-based diet. I think Game Changers should be a required film for this course, to delve further into the vegan diet and educate/encourage people to make the change, even if it is for selfish reasons.

I watched Wasted this time since I’ve seen Cowspiracy a number of times and I remember having the same shocked reaction as you. I thought all of the numbers and facts were unbelievable and I just cried and felt like I couldn’t go on eating animals any longer. I completely agree with you that people have so many reasons to go vegan. If you don’t care about the environment then fine, don’t you care about your own health? If you don’t care about your own health, can’t you see the ethical reasoning for not consuming animals? I can understand why people have a hard time wrapping their head around the whole thing, but I think when it comes down to it it’s about empathizing with other living beings and putting the well-being of the Earth before your own desires for a cheeseburger or a steak. My aunt knows about the devastating torture that animals go through to be prepared as food for humans, but she refuses to watch a documentary like Cowspiracy because she doesn’t want to witness it and consciously tries to block it out of her mind so that she can continue consuming animal products without guilt. I think this is honestly terrible because once I found out about animal agriculture I really felt like something wasn’t right in myself until I stopped eating animal products. I know that vegan options are becoming more widely available which is amazing because it shows that society is moving in that direction so hopefully, one day eating plant-based can be completely normalized. I like that you suggest Game Changers because it’s films like these that can reach a wide audience to educate and inform. I also would recommend the documentary called Dominion. It is heart wrenching, but a must watch. Here’s the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=LQRAfJyEsko&feature=emb_title&has_verified=1

Going into Cowspiracy I was already a vegetarian. I would like to think that had I not been the movie would have changed my mind, it certainly solidified my choice. However, in talking to some of my other housemates, some of which had previously seen the documentary and some of whom watched it with me for this class, they all had the initial desire to switch to a plant-based diet but then never followed through.  Similarly, the film made me want to go even further and switch to a vegan diet, that was until my roommate made a quesadilla later that night. These instances made me realize just how integrated the meat industry is into our everyday lives, even those exposed to this documentary, and even people like me who are already making somewhat of an effort to combat this industry in their diets.  In realizing this it helped me to understand how the seemingly delusional people interviewed could think the way they do, maybe that person genuinely believed that they were working in the meat industry because they care about the animals. This goes to show just how important the spreading of the central message of this film is. We need to inform people of this problem that is largely being ignored and sometimes even covered up or else the industry is going to grow and dominate more lives than it already does, at which point the numerous problems outlined in the video are just going to get worse.

Upon watching Cowspiracy, I have very conflicted feelings. The film highlights an industry that everyone, no matter what they eat, is connected to and outlines solid changes people can make in their lives to have a positive effect on the world around them. After watching this documentary, I am shocked by the fact that meat and dairy consumption has such a huge environmental impact, even more than any mode of transportation. This movie is actually what made me stop eating red meat, because I learned that the cattle industry is so much more water intensive and uses way more land resources than other types of meat production, like poultry for example.  What bothers me about this film, however, is the fact that many of the facts and numbers cited in the film are actually incorrect. These inaccuracies make you question the integrity of the entire film, because then even if the numbers seem staggering, if even one figure is inaccurate, it makes the viewer question if they can trust any of the other information presented. This also detracts from the validity of all climate movements, because climate deniers will just latch onto this and use it as an example of climate activists making up data, which could end up hurting the movement as a whole. So while this film highlights a very important issue, I’m not sure how beneficial it is overall, as the inaccuracies detract from the overall message of the film

Apart from the eerie parallels drawn between Anthony Bourdain’s commentary during the film and how he passed two years ago, I found the film Wasted really enjoyable and easy to watch. The film dove deep into food waste and approached it from various angles of different chefs and explained the life cycle of food and how we can waste less of it. 

            <br><br>

Seeing how grocery stores keep way more food in stock than necessary reminds me of fast fashion in a way because they feed off of marketing their products in a way that encourages people to buy more than they need. I’m definitely guilty of buying two of something just because it’s on sale so it makes me feel like I’m getting a deal, but do I really need to get the 2 for $5 when I will only eat one? 
            <br><br>


I found it very interesting to see the cauliflower plant and how as a society it is only normal to eat the “main” white part. Similarly, we generally don’t eat carrot or strawberry tops, but in reality, they’re totally edible. I remember making a smoothie once and putting the entire strawberry in (top and all) and my friend was like “what are you doing??” as if it was inhumane to consume a strawberry top. What I’m trying to say is that I wish that we could collectively move towards eating the entirety of a plant and viewing wasting food as revolting. It’s true that it doesn’t make sense to waste most of a cauliflower plant or any plant for that matter. The Daily Table store in Massachusetts is doing something amazing for their community especially because in areas that are less wealthy and therefore are home to more minorities, have less access to healthy plant-based food. I honestly think that most cities should have a similar system in place to cycle the “undesired” food from typical grocery stores to communities who need it and keep it out of the landfill. 

            <br><br>

Also, other schools should take notes from the garden program at the elementary school in Tennessee because teaching kids about the importance of the food cycle will result in knowledgable, mindful, and empathetic adults. I’m glad that I am now learning about this, but growing up I had never even heard of composting or environmental impacts of food waste or anything similar. 
            <br><br>


I’ve watched Cowspiracy many times and thankfully, it’s what planted the seed for me changing my diet to a plant-based one which is the last thing I thought I would do years ago. I used to be the person that would say, “I could never be vegan,” but that was when I was ignorant. Continuing to learn about animal agriculture and food waste empowers me because I’m given more tools that I can use in my everyday life to do the best that I can to help save the planet and in turn, become a more compassionate and conscious person.

I was actually very excited to see Anthony Bourdain on my screen. I loved watching him for years and am grateful that he was able to deliver this message and add this film to his legacy. For the rest of your comment, though, I agree. I am definitely guilty of thinking of food scraps as totally inedible and just throwing them away, such as the tops of strawberries, and this film opened my eyes to just how much  nutrient-dense food I have been wasting all these years. And, to make matters worse, I considered myself someone who was aware of their food waste and thought that I wasted as little as possible. I was raised by a Mexican mother and a Korean father, so as the film mentioned, it was almost a sin to throw away food. It has always been ingrained in my brain to either not serve myself what I won't eat, or clean my plate. It always infuriated me seeing my friends toss their half eaten meals in the trash. However, I still managed to contribute my fair share to the food waste problem in a smaller, yet significant, way, in not treating all food as equal. All parts of all food can be used or re-used, and this film opened my eyes to that. I also became vegan from Cowspiracy, and now after watching Wasted! I am going to do all that I can to reduce my food waste and educate the people around me about how all food can be used.

"Cowspiracy" is a film that examines the significance of animal agriculture on the environment. The filmmakers do a good job of inspecting the curtains behind the agriculture industry. It is told that 51 percent of global greenhouse emissions come from the livestock industry, particularly cattle. Many of these organizations are apparently dedicated to being green and support climate change, yet they don't back up to their livestock production when it comes to its impacts. The filmmaker is always being denied to interviews and getting vague answers that dodge the question about the issue of animal agriculture.  I think we need to better understand not just where our food is coming from, but also how much harm it can bring to the environment and our future. Earth cannot support our dietary habits at this rate. But even a small change of consumption products can help everyone move toward a sustainable planet.

After watching "Cowspiracy", I was also shocked to see how many green organizations denied the impact of the beef industry on the environment. I was saddened to see this, as many people in our class probably look up to these organizations as leaders in the environmental movement. While it is easy for people to make changes in their everyday lives to help the environment, these changes only account for a small percentage of the environmental impact caused by our society. The amount of water, energy, and CO2 emissions associated with the beef industry is staggering compared to the impacts caused by the meat industry. If such environmental organizations want to see real change happen, they must stand up to the industries causing the most environmental harms rather than just market themselves to regular individuals. One part of the film that struck me was when one of the men being interviewed stated that a person cannot be an environmentalist if they eat meat. Although this comment is quite straightforward, I understood what this man was saying. People can make changes such as taking shorter showers and changing their lightbulbs, but at the end of the day, their diet will likely make up a huge portion of their carbon footprint. After taking into account the amount of waste, cruelty, and destruction in the meat industry, I feel even more convinced to eliminate meat from my diet.

“Cowspiracy” forced me to do a lot of reflecting on myself. I come from a family that eats a lot of meat. Like, a lot of meat. My dad loves cooking steaks or lamb chops for us, and much of my extended family enjoys activities such as duck hunting. I’ve always known that I have a distaste for the process of raising and killing animals for food, but for some reason could never get myself to actually give up eating meat. Now that this documentary has enlightened me on the drastic impact agribusiness has on our planet, it’s given me a bigger reason to finally start making lifestyle changes I’ve wanted to make for a long time. Hearing that raising livestock produces more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation industry was incredibly shocking, especially considering how much we’ve learned about the damage transportation causes. I was even more shocked by how much water is involved in the process. It essentially takes 600 gallons of water to produce 1 quarter-pounder burger? A burger isn’t worth it. This film has personally inspired me to finally make the choice to stop eating red meat, and hopefully eventually cut out meat altogether. 
            <br><br>


I found myself getting incredibly frustrated with the businesses interviewed in the movie. I actually looked into Greenpeace’s statement as to why they chose not to participate in the film, and it all sounded like one big excuse to me. There is no reason big enough to justify not participating in a project based on healing the planet, especially if they want to call themselves an environmental activist group. I’m greatly struggling to find any respect for Greenpeace within myself; I DO however have much respect for Sister Dorothy Stang and the other 1,100 activists killed in Brazil over trying to speak out against cattle ranching in the Amazon. It’s time for these businesses to stop being cowards and realize there won’t be any profit for them to make when the planet gives out on us.

It is crazy that one of the simplest things to do (plant based diet) can help the climate crisis so much. I come from the same type of family as you- barbecue for every occasion and meat in basically every meal. After joining this class I decided to go vegan and it honestly is not as difficult as it sounds! This film definitely inspired me and I respect the sources they reached out to considering they were relevant and powerful. The scene with the fishing disturbed me and whenever I see something like that on social media I just scroll past, but I think that that scene and the deforestation of the rainforest is what angered me the most. They do these things for money, and act as if the money will protect them from the climate change, but reality check- if we do not do something soon our world will be done. Im glad this film was made and put on Netflix because hopefully it reaches a larger audience and educate a few more people.

I resonate with your comment very much.  It has been very hard for me, despite how easy it would be to switch to vegetarian in the dining commons, to fully let go of meat.  But recently after watching the documentary, I feel more motivated to make the change I have been meaning to make.  My problem is that I see documentaries like this and change for a small amount of time, until I eventually let go of my enthusiasm as the images and facts fade from my mind.  This time, though, I have been pretty good about sticking to my guns.  Even so, my family is very meat oriented, whether we mean it or not.  It is hard when I come home to focus on my mainly plant based diet when most meals contain meat of some kind.  When I told my parents, they were very supportive of course, but it is often hard to change lifestyles, which is evident in any household.  Even then, I found myself thinking about my grandparents.  They live in Texas, and the way they live (despite living in the city area of Austin) is by going to hunt once a year for the amount of meat they will eat for that year.  Usually that is only about one deer between the two of them that they dry and use when they need it.  I look up to them.
             <br><br>
I do disagree with what you said about the businesses, though.  Not all of them have the time to answer or accommodate every email or desire to meet or be interviewed.  I imagine that they did not decline it because of who asked, but because they merely did not want to deal with it.  I know for a fact they would not answer me if I asked them to involve themselves in a environmentalistic project I am planning. They might not have known it was credible and worth their time at the time.  But also, if they did know, that is no excuse for Greenpeace.  I completely agree with you in that case; there is no excuse.

<br><hr>
The film, “Cowspiracy,” also made me reflect a lot on my own and family’s eating habits. Often, we would consume a lot of dairy and meats, and my parents would always say it’s to help us grow. However, as the documentary highlighted, you can still be vegan and live a healthy lifestyle. One of the interviewees made a really good point that we are not baby cows, and it is unnatural of us to be drinking another animal's milk. Similarly, it would be unnatural and even weird for animals to be drinking human milk. I was also shocked that not only does cows produce methane but it uses up so much land and water! 
             <br><br>
I kind of understand why these organizations refuse to speak for the documentary. As the two other interviewees mentioned, they were under a lot of dumb legal stuff for speaking out. Big organizations who are trying to do good might not want to be tied up in those kinds of things, which makes me sort of understand their decision, but I still do think they should advocate against livestock regarding the environment.



<br><hr>
I admire that you chose to stop eating red meat. Honestly, the "Cowspiracy" is incredible and frustrating. It made the environmental crisis seem so difficult to solve that I was frustrated after the crisis ended. The first is because the statistics are shocking. People don't think a small option to eat meat a day makes any difference, but the movie makes it clear. Also, this movie is frustrating because although I did my best to minimize my influence and I have started eating vegetarian food, I have a realistic understanding that many Americans would not want to do this. It's like what the movie says, that is, more than 75% of the population consider themselves environmentalists, but people are actually unwilling to make sacrifices for their lives.

Understanding more about how the beef industry affects the planet was very good for me. For a while, I've been hearing that in order to really work on saving the planet, we have to become vegetarian or vegan. I didn't really understand how this could be true, so it was interesting to see how the fine details work out. I also thought it was encouraging to know that there really is something we can do in this regard, even if it is difficult. While once again greedy corporations refuse to take accountability for their part in climate change, we can all eat lentils instead of beef and this problem goes away. It will be difficult to make this happen, but it is definitely possible.

I knew about the issues of methane emissions from the animal agriculture industry and many of those around animal cruelty in the animal agriculture industry, but I did not know the extent of the issue posed by the industry to out planet as they were discussed in the film “Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret”. I knew that animal agriculture was an issue, but I didn’t t know that it was THE issue. I didn’t know that this was the main issue we should be talking about because it is the largest cause of environmental degradation in our world today. It’s a weird melange of feelings of both confusion and betrayal because I have spent most of my life believing that the fossil fuel industry has been the “enemy”. Environmental groups have focused their efforts towards fossil fuel companies as a common enemy because it was easier than targeting people’s day-to-day lifestyle choices. As was stated in the film, many environmental organizations followed a similar/identical “victim and perpetrator… plotline” so that their members weren’t feeling “attacked” even though it is called “manmade” climate change for a reason. While I am disappointed and frustrated that I was never exposed to the true extent of this issue due to our capitalistic system that seems to be controlled by, I still think it isn’t fair to demonize environmental organizations for their part in the issue. They are working towards the same goals, whether by fighting big agro companies or big fossil fuel companies. I think they have been trying to what they can within the rules of the system, but it’s time we break free of that toxic and detrimental system. It has poisoned our society for long enough. We have to teach these organizations that it is time to change instead of criticizing them.
             <br><br>

Also, I was shocked to find out that that even our oceans were feeling the heat from from animal agriculture and suffering therefore. The dead zones in the ocean caused by nitrogen flooding coming from farms inland seemed horrifying. Dead spaces are scattered throughout our planet due to animal agriculture, both on land in desertification and in the waters as dead zones. The idea of fishless oceans in 2048 is terrifying, but it is a plausible reality if we don’t change our ways. I loved the analogy of comparing by-kill in the ocean to on-land because it makes you think about the issue in another light. Altogether this movie was really life-changing and I am going to recommend it to all my friends and family.

I really enjoyed the documentary “Wasted: The Story of Food Waste” because it not only explained the extent of food waste’s negative consequences, the film also presented a clear and simple plan for reducing food waste: feeding people first, then animals, then use food scraps to create renewable energy, and finally, compost instead of sending food waste to landfill. This strategy is easy to understand, simple, and can easily be implemented by the everyday person, especially with a nudge by the government in the right direction, such as the system in South Korea. Food waste there is weighed from each household, and families must pay a fee for the waste they produce. However, the country is able to divert almost all food scraps from landfill by collecting and converting the waste into energy. This system is truly genius - families are incentivized to waste less because of the fee, the fee in turn funds the labor necessary to collect the food waste, and the government benefits from the revenue of produced energy. I feel that such a system should be implemented in many more countries; the US, one of the most wasteful countries in the world, could certainly benefit from it.
              <br><br>
I was shocked to hear that it takes a head of lettuce up to 25 years to decompose in a landfill - I assumed similarly to the folks interviewed who guessed it might take a few weeks to a month. Knowing this fact, I’m able to put into perspective the massive amounts of food we throw away just sitting in landfills for decades, and the amount of methane produced by this waste now makes sense. I feel that as a UCSB student I’m very lucky, as I benefit from the school’s commitment to cutting down on waste by composting most food waste, even if it isn’t thrown into the compost bin originally. After watching Wasteful, I know that I will pay much more attention to what I let go to waste.

I don't share the same optimism about food waste fees - or even reward systems - largely because I'm worried that especially with a fee for wasting food, families simply lie about what counts about food waste instead of actually reducing food waste. I am cautiously optimistic about the other efforts to reduce food waste, though using biowaste to create methane to burn for producing energy seems like a very roundabout way to release more greenhouse gasses into the environment.


<br><hr>

I agree with you. I liked how the film showed all the different ways food waste can be used: it can make beer, be converted to energy, create compost, and be used in other dishes. It's such a shame that so much food is wasted. Supermarkets throw away food instead of donating or composting it. The average American spends $1500 every year on food they'll never eat. The problem in America is that we don't have a system that does anything with our food waste - it just ends up in a landfill. We should have garbage cans specifically for food waste so that it can be reused. We should educate people that it can be used as compost to make better soil. In the film they showed a company that made unused bread into beer. We can have companies in the U.S. make food using unused food. We can also distribute uneaten food to homeless shelters. Food waste has so many uses and it's a shame that our country doesn't use it to its full potential. I agree that the film made me look more closely at the food I waste. I feel like I should only buy what I need instead of buying excess food. It will save money and resources.
<br><hr>
Having seen Cowspiracy in a previous class instructed by Ken, I chose to watch “Wasted: the Story of Food Waste” and like yourself I was upset by the colossal amount of waste we produce as a country, yet very encouraged by just how simple and attainable a huge reduction in this waste could be. The movie gave me a much greater understanding of the cycle, or lack thereof, between nutrients, soil, agriculture, consumption and disposal. In an effort to produce more and more, we have upset this cycle and it affects our produce, health, and planet’s future. I had no idea the immense effect that decomposing food in landfills has on our planet's climate. And even if there was no reason to be concerned for our climate, it’s simply unethical that so much food goes to waste when there are people, within our borders, that too often go hungry.
             <br><br>
But what I liked most about the movie was it’s numerous examples of places that have achieved a reduced or even waste free lifestyle. South Korea was one you mentioned, and I thought the recent legislation passed against food waste made by Paris and Italy are very promising. 
             <br><br>
The movie makes attaining this goal or nearly zero food waste seem not only plausible, but easy. If we can make the necessary changes, at each step in the food process, there is hope that we can greatly reduce this portion of our emissions. It will take legislation, political activism, and as with anything climate related, a shift in our culture as Americans. While the movie put a great deal on the influence of chefs and professionals, I think it’s also important that we as consumers start caring more about where our food is from when we buy it, and where its going when we are finished.

After watching "Wasted," a lot of my questions were answered regarding waste and where it actually goes. It's a question that a lot of us stumble upon, especially on days where we find ourselves emptying the expired food in our kitchens. There's a lot of waste that goes on in my place, and it's unimaginable to me considering the amount of trash and wasted food that IV contributes let alone restaurants. Anyway, it's good to finally know that 40% our food goes to waste, 90% of which straight to the methane-producing landfill where a vegetable will take 25 years to decompose. Pretty lame and disappointing if you ask me. 
             <br><br>

In America, poverty is prevalent in many areas; however, hunger is often overlooked because the cheapest options can also be the most fattening, unhealthy, and easily accessible (fast food). Some people probably hear about food banks and think, "oh that's for poor people" but you know it's actually coming out of your tuition and the food is Perfectly fine. We gotta utilize these resources more. The main issue for me is making a routine that consists of having an adequate food supply and cooking healthy meals. I don't want to pull the whole college student thing, but I just never give myself the time lately to buy groceries, make my own meals, manage the ins and outs of my cupboards, etc. This is something I have the power to work on and Wasted has reminded me why fully taking advantage of ones food supply is important. 
             <br><br>

I love that they talked about the "Best By:" marks on products and how they are extremely misleading. Most of the time I find myself tossing the food at my job because we legally have to and the food looks perfectly fine so I become guilty and take the whole damn thing. It should be illegal to just throw away food like that. I'm not saying we should just open up more markets that give away free food because that'll lead to more dependency, but a better way to salvage the product would be nice because it goes to the landfill I bet. 
             <br><br>

Okay the whole beer thing and using pieces of bread is genius. Excellent idea and very intriguing for a lot of us I would say given that beer is a high demand product. Eco feed is also a great system because its a consistent way of feeding livestock health wise and much simpler. What I noticed is the show kept mentioning that using the entirety of an animal is a good way to not waste and I agree. It's just funny because Ken's always talking about plant-based diets and here we are. 
             <br><br>

My main thing with this is that there are a LOT of ideas like the food waste bins in South Korea and the school that has a garden education program that promotes composting to young children. Such excellent ideas and like Ken said, it would be so difficult for everyone to make a personal shift in life without laws and regulations to enforce it. I really wish it was as easy as "Everyone Has to follow these rules to save food Or Else." I know advocating for saving food should not even be a political platform because we should all save as much food as we can and that's just common sense.

I think this film was effective at communicating its subject of the extreme reality of the meat industry because it appeals to viewers on an emotional level that triggers a realization that this is something that needs to be fixed. This film achieved this by stating facts, using interviews, and showing video clips that depict the horrible conditions cows face. I think that the films audience can be broken down into two categories- environmental reformists and casual viewers. People who actively seek care for the environment will be willing to watch and learn more about what they might not already know. On the other hand, casual viewers like myself can watch this film and feel the need to become actively involved in the issues that are being brought up. In a way, the two viewer pools are interconnected because reformists seek and rely on changing the minds of the general population. 
             <br><br>
My general reaction to this film was one, pure disgust, and two, surprised. It’s funny how so many dark and unethical practices lie behind the two bright Golden Arches that millions of Americans are oblivious to their entire lifetimes. How can anyone justify anything right about the meat industry other than it fuels our satisfaction? We use ⅓ of our freshwater source alone to produce meat from cows and it takes more than 600 gallons of water to make a single quarter pounder burger. When you take this number and account for every fast food chain making burgers every day, the amount of resources we waste is absurd. 
             <br><br>

After watching the film, I learned that animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions due to the methane cows release into the atmosphere. It’s crazy that cows create more GHG emissions than all automobiles combined. It’s almost ridiculous to think that we have barely touched on trying to reduce this number when all we care about are making electric and more fuel efficient cars. I’m pessimistic because I know that this change will not occur anytime soon because so many Americans and people around the world do not know the truth and so many big businesses have to much money and power.

When I was watching Cowspiracy what was shocking to me was seeing how management members refused to speak on the effects of animal agriculture on the planet. And how animal agricultural companies refused to mention if they donated to environmental companies. Seeing how the animals were crammed into small spaces and then the agricultural management member said that those conditions were better for the animals was startling. This film was inspiring to me because it made me want to do something in order to help or contribute to lessening my carbon footprint. Even though the values were incorrect, it definitely still carries the message along and hopefully convinces more people in seeing how the animal agricultural companies are hurting the planet. And something they said in the film was that you could decide everyday to make the best choice which in this instant was to either be vegan or vegetarian, and I completely agree with them. This is something you can easily implement into your daily life, unless of course you have dietary restrictions or income as vegan choices can be at times pricier. Overall I enjoyed watching this film and I thought it was rather convincing as well as really showing the true faces of these corporations and even those that claim they are environmentally friendly, however I could understand why they would be afraid seeing that so many activists are murdered for fighting against the meat industry.

I was also shocked by the way management members refused to speak on how animal agriculture affects and contributes substantially to climate crisis. It got me mad to see how people would refuse to talk to him. Almost all doors were closed in his face and he reached out too sooo many people for answers, even went out of his way to drive a car that he had out a way to reduce his carbon footprint. 
             <br><br>

 What also caught my attention and made me laugh a little was the faces the Chief of water use and efficiency and the statewide Integrated Water Management when he asked them to comment on how animal agriculture comes to play in the climate crisis as they only discussed the water issue. They stayed silent for a long period as if  in shock trying to process what he said. The fact that they chose not to comment made it even more interesting. They could not even hide the fact that they knew something about the topic yet said “ it is not our area of expertise.”  Like he said there are these activist trying to bring awareness to all these other things causing harm to the planet yet choosing to ignore on of the biggest contributors of emission.

The film “cowspiracy” reveals that animal agriculture is the underlying truth of climate change. Before watching this film, I did not know that cows could lead to serious environmental destruction. From that, we know that how beneficial to our planet it is to be a vegetarian. Also, the film “Wasted” shocked me by showing how the destructing effect of the waste of food to the environment, which underlies the importance of not wasting food.

I was also just as shocked and disappointed by the way they refused to speak on how animal agriculture affects and highly contributes to the climate crisis. It honestly high irritated me that the fact almost everyone he tried to talk to just basically slammed the door in his face. It’s honestly just sad that people will talk about everything else that’s contributing to the climate crisis expect for the one that’s causing the most change in our planets atmosphere.

I completely agree with your comment. When I was watching this week’s film, I was both shocked at angry at the companies that were not willing to give out interviews. This alone shows that there is something very suspicious and telling about those companies. In addition, it was startling to see that these environmental companies (companies that are supposed to be experts in the field) did not address the issue of animal agriculture. Instead, they only focused on the issue of burning fossil fuels. However, there is a lot of data that supports that animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of climate change. This film also made me want to completely change my diet. Although I enjoy eating a hamburger as much as the next guy, knowing that eating one hamburger is equivalent to showering for two months will not sit well in my conscience. In addition, one reason why it is so easy for us to eat animals is that we do not see what happens behind the scenes. Seeing, for example, how much water and food cows need and watching chickens getting slaughtered makes it hard for me to justify my current eating habits.




<br><hr>

I felt the same way as you when I was watching the film “Cowspiracy.” The fact that many well-known and prestigious organizations refuse to say about the undeniable negative effects of animal agriculture on the global environment did shock me. Although by doing this, they are harming the environment just for their benefits, they can still quibble and say it is “understandable” to some extends--they have to do this because they need supports and reliable funds from other organizations. However, the thing that intolerant for and irritated me is that in Brazil, about 1100 activists were killed during the last twenty years just because they were telling the public the truth. These people who are related to animal agriculture in Brazil not only didn’t mention the negative effects of their industries themselves but also want others to shut up by killing them mercilessly. These murderers not just harmed the environment, they even killed the scientists who are trying to stop them, for the sake of earning profits.
                 <br><br>
 Speaking about the climate, I was also surprised by what Ken said in the lecture that simply by wasting less food, there will be a reduction of about 137 gigatons of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, which is twice as the effect of switching from fossil fuel-generated electricity to solar panel generated. More than that, after watching the film I also feel like that having less meat and changing to a plant-based diet is necessary for everyone who lived on the planet, as animal agriculture can harm the environment in the way and scale that far beyond people’s imagination. Animal agriculture occupied about 45% of the land on Earth, causing 91% of the destructions in Amazon, leading to the form of ocean “dead zone,” and consume about one-third of freshwater. Roughly 2500 gallons of water will be used up just to make one pound of beef. All of these show that it is essential for people to switch their diet, and they need to do this as soon as possible. There is no time to waste as every second, there will be one acre of rainforest being destroyed for grazing animals and growing the feed crops they need.

First I’m gonna say that when the man cut off the duck’s neck with our feeling any guilty, my heart was broken. And I would rethink about is it moral that human beings simply treat those livestocks as equal lives. As we slaughtering tons of livestocks everyday, are we doing good?  
                 <br><br>
 Back to the theme, we’ve taken too much from our planet. While we have extracted so much natural products and resources form the earth directly for our use as raw materials and fossil fuels, livestock industries has added a lot more burden to our planet. Before, wildlife has occupied 99% of biomass of our planet, but now wildlife only accounts for 2% biomass in total, because the number of humans and livestocks  skyrocketed in recent decades. Besides this, livestock industry has become the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emission within human activities. Transportation section in total only accounts for 13% of all gas emissions, but caw industry solely contributes 18%. What more important, raising livestock consumes 34 trillion gallons of water annually in the US; one quarter pound of hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to produce; nearly 50% of all grain production are feeding livestocks, leaving 1 billion people suffering from famine. 
                 <br><br>
 We can save our earth starting from reducing meet factories. I don’t mean to shut down all the factories in the same time, because I’m a meat lover. But we can at least consume less if we really care about our environment. For every single hamburger we eat, the water consumption accounts for the water amount that we can take shower for 2 whole months. Isn’t that terrifying to us all?  By doing this, we are not only benefitting the planet, but also ourselves. Given the external cost for livestock industries is high, every single one consumer is paying for that cost. So for our own sake, Let’s take some actions to make us all  better off.

thank you for sharing and I totally agree with your comment! When the film shows the part where the backyard farmer slaughtered his ducks and other livestock, it was pretty painful and unbearable for me to watch because I thought it was still somewhat cruel to kill those animals though they are raised by the farmer himself and he was killing them for food. Now onto your question of whether we are doing ourselves and our planet a favor by killing those animals for food, my answer is I don't think so because animal agriculture and meat production essentially take on such a heavy toll on our environment. I agree with how you mentioned that a huge portion of the carbon and methane emission comes from animal agriculture; much of the landmass on the planet is used for animal grazing and the ecological balance of those lands is permanently disrupted with the grazing of the livestock; countless tons of grains and gallons of water are wasted on feeding animals when we could have used the same amount of food and water to help millions of people starving on the planet right now. Rather we are feeding those precious food resources to the animals. The film also mentions towards the end that humans can live a healthy life and even thrive on a vegan diet completely devoid of meat and dairy products, so this becomes an obvious and easy question for the entire humanity: would we want to change our eating habits if doing so can have significant positive impacts on our environment? I think at this point people either have not realized the negative consequences of eating meat on the planet or they have realized it such as through watching this documentary but they are still knowingly reluctant to make necessary changes to their daily diets because as Ken mentioned in this lecture video introducing the film, what we eat in our diet is central to our cultures and identity. However, is it worth it to maintain our so-called "cultural identity" through eating meat and watch our planet deteriorate under the negative effects of meat and animal agriculture? We can express our cultural identity through so many other ways that we don't have to limit ourselves to our diets. I hope more people can realize this someday.

When I saw the data that one quarter pound of hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to produce, I was really shocked. I am also a meat lover like you and I can't have a meal without meat. Sometimes I ate two burgers for lunch, which requires water amount equal to 4 months of showers. I really should reduce the amount of beef I eat, or switch to chicken in order to help "pollute" less.

In the documentary “Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret”, it is claimed that animal agriculture plays a major rule in emitting carbon dioxide. As far as I am concerned, this ought to be the easiest and fastest way to reduce carbon emission as it does not require as much investment as other implementations, such as automobile cars. But for whatever reason, it seems that the government does not want to talk much about it and the reason is that this is regarding to behavior change. Well, then how about just do some advertisements to let people know what they are facing?
                 <br><br>
Before taking this course, I know that we are facing global warming and that is all. I have never pictured what my life is going to be like when I am 50 and what lives of people in the rest of thw world is going to be like. After watching those films and videos, I realize that we need to take actions and how severe the situation really is. Last week, I donated 10 dollars to protect the ocean and signed my email address to participate the program. This is a proof that through proper amount of education, people’s minds can be changed. 
                 <br><br>
The government certainly knows that advertisements on various social media are one way of doing this. But why aren’t they doing this? I think this has something to do with political interest which is way too deep for us to know. Using the power we have in hand, what is the solution for the future of human beings? Again, vote. Vote for the participants who will set legislation on carbon tax. We, as the educated ones among young generation, should take the responsibility to take care of the rest of the world.

I totally agree with what you said in your comment post. Like you, I was also brokenhearted after watching the film. I felt really guilty. It is definitely hard for me to continue eating hamburgers such as In & Out burgers after watching this film. As the film argues, agribusiness is definitely a 'human-eating issue...".We are definitely not doing good or helping the environment by slaughtering tons of livestocks everyday. I found it really disturbing that we literally went complete 180 on our biomass comparison to the other wildlife hundred years later.  I believe it is not too late to change our food consumption industry. We need to start looking for alternatives and possibly, look forward to switching our diet to plant-dietary food based. It is true that it is hard for humans to change our eating habits because of how our technology advances. Technological advancement has led us to mass produce everything, especially in the meat industry. I still believe that if we utilize technology in a way that will help us redirect our diet to a plant-based diet. We would definitely make a huge impact in dealing with the climate crisis.

I agree with Ken’s statement saying that it’s easier switching to a eco friendlier car than switching one’s diet. I speak from personal experience because it’s been pretty difficult trying to switch to a plant based diet myself. I think it’s based a lot on how I was raised and it’s like I’m being asked to change all of my habits by just changing this one small thing about myself. Where as if someone just told me to get a car that would have the same functions and help the environment, I would be more than excited and willing to do so. 
                 <br><br>
After watching cowspiracy, I was surprised in learning that cows produce more greenhouse gases than all the forms of transportation. It was kind of hard to wrap my head around it. All I could think about were the people standing outside of McConnells with the big tvs around them showing videos of animal cruelty on cows. It’s crazy how so much trouble comes from keeping livestock and a big portion of America is just basically depending on it to live. 
                 <br><br>
Not only is the production of livestock products a huge problem, but also the amount of food wasted that comes from it. I will continue to try reducing the amount of food I waste, and now more than ever will I encourage others to do it as well.

The film “Cowspiracy” was different compared to the other documentary Ken has had us watch in the past. It felt less formal and more child-like for the lack of a word. I think the fact that there were cartoon diagrams and just the way that the situation was approached, it made it out to be that way. This is not to say I didn’t like the film or think it was very insightful, because I did learn things about certain organizations and more regarding the contribution that cattle make to greenhouse gas emissions.
                 <br><br>

There were certain parts that made me really think about how bad what I eat is to the environment. For example how much water is used to feed the cows and grow the plants that they eat, and this is something that is not talked about, even when people try to, it’s covered up by organizations who have billions of dollars behind them along with lawyers. It’s sad really how it always comes back to money, and people trying to stay rich. Do they not see that in a couple years it won’t matter how rich they were if our planet becomes inhabitable? Oh, that’s right, they probably won’t be alive to suffer through the effects that will occur… but people aren’t ready to talk about that. Anyhow, one thing that really made me laugh was Kip Anderson saw a duck get killed and he said he has another appointment with someone else to watch a chicken go through the same process, but he said he couldn’t do it. Then it cut the scene of him and the chicken together in a car and I lost it! I was like why is this grown man petting a chicken, did he adopt it?!? But then he explained that he took it to an animal rescue, and it all made sense. Good transition if you ask me.

I agree with you that the film did feel a little less formal than other ones we have watched in class, like a few other students were talking about as well it was challenging to determine the legitimacy of the claims Kip Anderson was making. So something that I found interesting is after I watched the film I looked up their website, and through their website you have access too facts/statistics, meal planning, how to take action, and other types of resources that share the same idea as Cowspiracy. For all the students in our class wondering what they can do to make changes in their life, or even seeking more resources, their website really has a lot of useful information.

I have tried to be very conscious about how the food that I eat contributes to the environment. I actually have consumed a primarily vegetarian diet for the past 2 years. If I do have meat it is usually not beef because of what I have learned about the environmental impacts. When I really think about it though I cant really see how just 1 person skipping out on beef can have an impact on this monstrous issue and it is frustrating. I like what you said about how its sad that it always comes back to the money. I completely agree with you. A common theme in my response comments is that greed is at the core of what is running this planet into the ground. The people who care are the people who lack power, and the people who have power are the people who do not care.

I was a little nervous to watch this film because I have heard from gnarly things about it and I am a huge animal lover and was not looking forward to watching some of them get slaughtered. And I was right to be nervous, there were some scenes that made me pretty sad. But this film is trying to use these reactions to inspire us to turn emotions into action, and I think it was very successful at doing so. I have recently been making the transition to a more plant based diet (mostly because of this class), and I knew it would not work for me if I tried to do it all at once. So, my first step was to remove cow products from my diet. This was not a very difficult step, as I already don’t really drink milk or eat a lot of burgers. This film did a good job of highlighting different reasons to be more aware of your meat consumption. It discussed the environmental impacts (even if they were a bit embellished) and also the moral reasons to stop supporting an industry that has such little care for the animals well being. Because the meat industry, particularly the beef industry, is such a large contributor to greenhouse gases, removing meat from your diet can have a very large impact. Start with just cow products and work your way from there. This film was a good reminder to keep working towards becoming completely plant based, as there really is no good reason not to.

Before I started to watch the documentary film, I was really intrigued by its name“cowspiracy”, and after watching this film I really began thinking about the factors behind this huge conspiracy of cows that happened on a such large scale. In other words, I was really amazed by the fact that nearly every one of the directors interviewed in this film chose to neglect or to avoid the environment issue caused by raising cattle.Sadly, Some of them did not even mention the issue of agriculture. The statistics juxtaposed in the film is appalling, 51% of greenhouse emissions are from farm-based agriculture  rather than 13% given by government authorities. They would blame the increase of CO2 to all other factors like forest destruction, excessive land-use, and over fishing… But why would they neglect cattle raising?  Why would such a common phenomenon even oversaw by some renowned environmental organizations?Thinking deeper, the root for this thing itself is the culture we have been used to for hundreds or even thousands of years. It is never easy to demand people to change their diets to  plant-based ones. As we could see the devastating outcomes  for people who has stand out for that. So did these organizations, because they would say it is hard and impossible but they also do not want to express it directly. So they” conspired” to choose conceal this topic without any mentioning.
                 <br><br>

Another thing that I really want to mention is that, I think we should try to alter the diet from  now on. Make a small step of change just from ourselves.  There is a ironic sentence in the beginning of the film that” Why we have tried to turn off the light bulbs, take a shower less than 10 minutes, use public transportation like riding a bike to commute in recent years, but the earth is still worsening? “ One answer, I believe, to this question is that we have not start to solve this problem from its origin. Hardly had I seen the solutions proposed by the governments and other public orgs related to food consumption or the changing the composition of our diets. This would continue to happen with the incessant growth of  population which means our demand for meat such as cattle would not reduce unless we start to change right now. And look at the outcomes of raising such a tremendous number of cows. We have to take up other land for agriculture, to reform the land, to cut down the rainforests that are called the lungs of earth, to pollute the ocean, and even kill other creatures( Believe me, I feel extremely heart broken when I saw the devastating expression of the wild animals). Just reconsider, does it really worth to consume beef all the times? Why don’t we change to a diet with more sustainable options like plants. We could not only attain sufficient nutrients, but also get the flavor we want with different condiments.
                 <br><br>

The expenses for raising cattle is huge, not only economically huge, but also ecologically, culturally huge. The only way we could deal with that is to change from ourself. Less demand for beef, less cattle and better environment.

"Cowspiracy" is an informative film that exposes the meat industry and how environmentally damaging it is. Before watching this film, I was already aware of the devastating environmental effects that the cow industry. Maintaining livestock requires an abundance of resources, from water, feed, and land. Not only is it expensive to maintain, but the treatment practices of these animals are not regulated. People treat the animals very poorly, and abuse isn't uncommon in the meat industry.

At first, I was very shocked with the facts presented. After reading that some of the facts are
incorrect and over exaggerated, I felt as if the whole effect of the documentary was diminished.
It made me think about my stance as a meat consumer and also brings up the question of
privilege in our everyday diets. I do agree that vegetables and fruit are better than the average
Whopper, but to consume the former in our daily lives is an extreme privilege. Many Americans
resort to fast food because of the affordability and accessibility-- it is unfair to shame them for
doing what they need to do to survive. The deeper issue is healthy food security in the United
States, and the truth is that majority of Americans will never adapt a meat-free lifestyle because
of how inaccessible "healthy" food is overall.
I learned deeply about how consuming meat is harmful to our environment. However, if
anything, it made me think deeper about the food insecurity present in our country. I have the
privilege to switch my diet to a meat-free lifestyle, and that does make a small difference.
However, how can my fellow peers do the same if a Whopper and fast food chicken wings is
more accessible to them than a salad? If we had the opportunity to create an equal meat-free style
for all, it would help tremendously. Of course we each can individually do our part to not
consume meat but we can only reach that point if we address why people tend to consume meat
in the first place.

Cowspiracy was a really interesting film to watch and did a great job at showing the viewer how detrimental animal agriculture is to our environment. I definitely wanted to change the way I eat after watching this but then you have to think about how you would need to actively change your diet. I know for a lot of people it's easier to not have to consciously think about the food you're putting into your body. For example, a tired parent would probably rather stop at some fast food chain than go home and try to make a home cooked meal.

I find "Cowspiracy" very inspiring. I think it is very brave of Kip to go out there and ask the question that no one has the courage to ask-- why isn't agriculture mentioned as the biggest cause of the destruction of the Amazon rain forest. Agriculture uses such a large percentage of water that even the petrol industry can't compare. However, the environmental protection organizations choose not to say anything because they think it will upset the people who fund the organizations. As the analogy in the documentary says, this is like a broken family with a alcoholic father but no one is saying anything about the father. 
                 <br><br>
I was shocked to learn that eating a quarter-pound burger is equivalent to showing for two month, and I decided to consume less meat. Not only is agriculture water-intensive, it is also land-intensive. To grow grains for the cows that we eat and to graze them, rainforests are being erased everyday and it causes massive species distinction. I think sometimes we forgot that the Earth is not only our home but also home to thousands of species. Us, one species, taking over 98% of the planet for ourselves is such a selfish thing to do. 
                 <br><br>
"Cowspiracy" has gave me a new perspective on eating meat and its impact. Seeing people like Kip who is willing to dedicate his life for the cause of saving the planet is very heart-warming. This movie really gives me hope that there are lots of people out there taking actions and I'm inspired to do the same.

firstly expained the impact of food waste, and then clearify the plan to
minimize this problem: we feed human first, and then animals, then use the rest
of scraps to produce renrewable energy, and lastly compost wastes instead of
sending them to landfill. it made perfect sense to audiences, at least to me.
this strategy is easy to carry out, especially with helps from the governments.
people need to pay for their wastes, so that they will intend to minimze the waste.
this suggestion is genius, families have incentive inspriation to waste less
and the governments have money as their motivation to collect and classify
garbages. This strategy should be carry out asap!

I do agree that the format of the film Wasted! The Story of Food Waste! was straightforward and directly conveyed the persuasive message of people needing to be more aware of their waste effectively. Given that, the strategy you detailed in your comment is one that really should be widely implemented by the public. The simple action of recycling food sources in the form of composting has the potential for the cultivation of more sustainable, carbon-rich nutritious land plants can thrive in. The planet can be slowly restored through this process. In addition, new environmentally friendly programs and initiatives on the benefits of micro agricultural methods and other greener incentives can be further promoted. Juxtaposing this movement with the current detriments imposed upon the planet from the meat industry, as illustrated in the film Cowspiracy, I would hope there would be great reconsideration of lifestyle choices from those who support the meat industry with their dollars of consumption.

One of the hardest parts of watching Cowspiracy was honestly seeing the duck being slaughtered. During my efforts to eat a largely plant based diet it has still been difficult to completely cut out meat, but that visual will never leave my head. I think Kip Anderson said it best when he said “If I can not do it then I do not want someone else doing it for me”. There is no way that I would be able to do anything even remotely similar to slaughtering any animal, and I sometimes forget the preparations that occur for me to eat what is on my plate. The simple fact that six hundred and sixty gallons of water are used for one burger hopefully would steer people into avoiding eating burgers as often as they do if that fact was well known. Also learning that five percent of water is domestic and fifty five percent of water is from animal culture really put into perspective how massive in scale the production of animal products is. Nonetheless, the visual presented in the film as well as the perspective Kip takes on the climate change crisis is extremely professional while being easy to understand. Kip does an amazing job of showcasing the “hidden” leading cause of anthropogenic climate change being animal agriculture. So many organizations focus on the transportation sector or other factors that are almost insignificant compared to the HUGE impact that raising livestock has and for what? Viewing the issue from the agribusiness aspect I understand the political and economic standing behind such an industry but almost sheltering people from this information is incredibly wrong. The fact that Sister Dorthy Stang was killed for speaking out about cattle ranching is mind boggling to me. How is this allowed to continue in our society at all? Fifty one percent of all human caused climate change is because of animal agriculture and people are pretending that the sun is to blame or another ridiculous subset of the larger problem. This documentary is definitely what I needed as the extra push to completely allow me to change my habits for good. Nonetheless, knowing that 1.4 tons of carbon savings are due to me not consuming beef makes me pleased with the influence I have had, even if it is small. The statistics that were presented were mind blowing, and this documentary was released in 2014. It is difficult to imagine how these statistics changed and at what point in destruction of our world we are at now.

I also felt that watching the duck get slaughtered was incredibly disturbing. But what the documentary failed to show, was the other three billion animals (including fish) that are killed every day. Though the duck slaughter was grotesque, in comparison to the various ways the majority of livestock animals are killed, the duck slaughter was actually humane. These ducks appeared to live a good life (up to the point of their slaughter) with ample land and feed and even an owner that talked to them. Yet, most livestock animals in the United States live in unsanitary, cramped conditions, are injected with antibiotics, are mutilated, are genetically manipulated, are separated from their families and are murdered at an early age.   

                 <br><br>

I think that one of the main reasons that people who have strong morals continue to eat meat is that we have this disconnect. We do not see the patty in our hamburger as a living animal. We do not see that cows actually share 80% of their genes with humans and complicated animals capable of feeling a wide range of emotions. Most importantly we do not see the patty in our hamburger as a being that does not want to die. No matter how you slaughter the cow, whether the killing is humane, kosher, fast or “painless” the fact is that it is not the cows desire to die. Especially since it’s life is being taken away so that humans can pay a few dollars to bite into its juicy flesh. It is disgusting that cows and other livestock exist solely to quench people’s desire for meat. We are terminating the life of an animal, an animal who has the capacity to live many long years so that we can blindly consume it in a matter of minutes. 

                 <br><br>

I have been vegetarian for six years and vegan for two and I actually am ok with people eating meat. However, as you mentioned earlier in your comment, I believe that people should not be eating meat if they are not willing to kill the animal themself. Furthermore, I believe that when people eat meat, they should take a moment to really savor what they are eating, after all an animal’s life was dedicated to providing that meat. The documentary made me angry about the meat industry, especially given that environmental organizations are not taking action on an industry that accounts for 15% of greenhouse gas emissions. However, reading through the comments on Ken’s video made me optimistic about the future again. I actually started smiling when I saw numerous people commit to decreasing their consumption of meat or cutting meat out of their diet completely.


<br><hr>
I also believe the hardest part of the documentary to watch was at the duck farm. Every time I think of Cowspiracy it will forever be ingrained in my mind. In fact since watching this documentary, I feel myself constantly thinking about the food I choose to eat now as that slaughter scene replays in my head. However, as much as I want to stop eating meat or dairy, it will still be very hard and that makes me feel guilty. Like you mentioned, I would never slaughter an animal but I feel the whole population is desensitized to where our food comes from. This is seen in the film on all of the farms that were visited. The children know not to get close to the animals from a very young age while the parents have taught themselves that they're jobs of slaughtering these animals is strictly business. Eating any kind of meat just doesn't seem worth it anymore. Not only are there alternative options, the entire industry is corrupt and polluting our planet. Yet I find myself struggling to give it all up. Watching the leaders who had a position in the environmental movement refuse to speak out was frustrating. I think we both agree that making climate change political is wrong and it's insane that people lose their lives over this issue. While this was the darkest film we've seen so far, it does make you want to change for the better . Knowing that personally changing my diet can make a big impact makes me feel better. It also makes you optimistic realizing how mainstream plant based diets have become.

The file is indeed effective at communicating its subject by using the method of contrast. The man in the film used himself as an example to illustrate this. First he tries to tell us how he really treasures the environment and what he did to achieve, then compares to his research that live stocks waste much more resources that he tries to save in order to emotionally appeal to the audiences, which is more that being effective, since he tries to touch the audiences intellectually and emotionally. It also draws people’s attention in the beginning so that people will continue focus on the film when he reaches deeper after. The film’s audiences can be both people concerned about this issue and casual viewers. Since the man in the film illustrates the issue from swallow informations and gradually reaches deeper, and finally even discusses the controversial topic of whether people should be vegan or not. First, by using appeal to emotion, he touches people’s heart by showing his wasted efforts, then by showing a lot of accurate datas except one, such as the tremendous number of water consuming, he proves his argument valid. Then finally he draws people to think more and find solutions to solve this serious environmental problem.
                 <br><br>
My feeling is both intellectual and emotional, but generally this urgent issue should be solved as soon as possible, since people did not even notice how serious the situation can be and the government is still hiding this from the public. I even feel a little anxious about it, since environmental issue is much bigger that the social issues. In general, our era is just a small period of the Earth time, and we are saving our society by destroying the base of surviving and other species, which is completely wrong. It does help me learning by giving me more information, but my attitude is as always- saving out planet by doing as much as we can. But as someone who eats meat, I don’t know if “the vegan opinion” is right, since humans are natural meat eater if we see human as a kind of animals, and being vegan is changing what we actually are and it is probably not right or it will take human a long time to evolve or degenerate. In general, my attitude is still positive that we should do our best to save the planet. I would recommend this film to my friends, since we should always learn and also absorb new perspectives whether we agree with or not. Moreover, this documentary film is interesting to watch and it makes people think by continuing providing new opinion by different kinds of people, so the audience won’t feel bored.

Honestly, I feel that Cowspiracy lost some credibility once I heard that the food industry is only responsible for 15% of the GHG emissions, not 51%. It is a pretty big difference and claiming it as fact just makes me want to take a step back from the doc and not support it as much as I want to. However, if you can disregard this blatant mistake, Cowspiracy was very enlightening, and I thought it was well made. The way facts, at least I hope they are still facts as they might not be very credible, were presented was nice and easy to follow.
                 <br><br>
I think a good point that was made in the movie was how due to humans giant population growth, we are making the food industry be as bad as it is. It is so crazy that 200 years ago, our population was around 1 billion, and 100 years ago it was only 1.5 billion, and now it is 7 BILLION. It's hard to imagine how this could even happen. And the fact that we could adequately feed every human with the food that we feed our livestock, yet can't adequately feed every human with those livestock due to it being wasted in wealthier areas is so mind boggling. Humans really need to switch our diets, and it is going to be one of the hardest culture shifts ever. 
                 <br><br>
I am glad this movie was completed and has been watched by many and has not been completely silenced by the livestock industry like it could have been. It is important for people to watch documentaries like this one in order to be able to have that culture shift I mentioned earlier. I only wish there were no errors in their facts in order to restore credibility, but otherwise it was a good watch.

I am very interested in our food systems and in how our diets contribute to climate change. I have been vegan since middle school, and have done a lot of research and reading on the damaging environmental effects of animal agriculture. I did not hear about the role food waste plays in our climate crisis until last quarter. I liked this documentary because it provides examples of ways people are using food waste. The eco feed industry in Japan is amazing as it uses food waste and creates nutritious food for the pigs that eventually produces some of the best tasting meat, and it saves farmers money! The chefs focusing on using the entirety of the plant are amazing. This issue of food waste is relatively new to me and I learned a lot about it through this documentary. The reading this week showed how high food waste reduction is on the list of solutions for the climate crisis, and then this documentary helped me understand it. The issue is also of great importance because of how many people are starving and food insecure in the world so the problem of food waste is not only relevant environmentally. I am so impressed by Chef Mossimo Bottura and how he is redirecting food waste to hungry people. This film has me very interested in food waste and I am going to look more into it. I am going to recommend this to many of my friends and family members. I am surprised by how unknown this issue is while it is something we all contribute to every day.

I have always wanted to watch this documentary so I was excited when I saw the title on this weeks films. I thought that this was a great documentary because it gave many different point of views. CEO’s of companies, environmentalists, people who raise animals for their own consumption and others. What I didn’t understand was why do people deny that animal agriculture is the second leading cause of emissions. For example the two men that work for the Sacramento congress or the head of companies. Will people in the US hate them that much for saying that animals are contributing to climate change? If I didn’t know much about climate change and people were saying that we should be eating less meat and try to stick to a plant based diet I wouldn’t riot. I thought the producers did a good job at making the viewer feel bad for eating animals such as when that guy chopped the ducks head off. That was really gruesome for me and made me really upset. They also had a lot of clips of children with animals or people and animals and it being a nice relationship between the person and the animal. My favorite part was when the guy referred cows milk to baby calf growing food. That was funny. I really enjoyed this documentary and it reminds me why I don’t eat cow products. I wonder how much of a difference it would make if we just stopped eating beef and drinking milk. Almost everyone uses a milk substitute nowadays and I think turkey is a great substitute for beef. I don’t think the earth could ever be 100% animal consumption free but if we just stopped using cows I think it could make a difference.

The film was effective in communicating its message. It’s goal was to highlight the advantages of a vegan lifestyle and it did that in a few ways. It explained the logical reasons for going vegan with charts, numbers, and other data. The narrator also establishes a relationship with the audience; he is acting as if he’s revealing a large secret to us. The film highlights that many organizations don’t mention animal agriculture as an environmental problem, and we as the audience are superior because we now know of cows’ consequences. The film also appeals to the audience's empathy. The film depicts a duck being slaughtered. It’s very emotional for the audience to think about where their food comes from. It makes them feel guilty for being responsible for the murdering of animals. 
                 <br><br>

The film is directing its message to Americans who are concerned about climate change and want to individually help the climate crisis. This film helps provide information on how one can limit their contribution of greenhouse gasses on ways that are more unpopular. Another audience of the film might be non meat eaters (such as myself) who want a reason to feel good about the decisions they’re making. 
                 <br><br>

The use of incorrect fact is what makes this video incredibly, and is why I wouldn't reccommend it to a friend. The sprerad of fake news has the power to truly hurt people, and I believe that if you are in a position of power, then you should not be encouraged to drastically misinform the public.

"Cowspiracy" is one of my favorite documentaries ever. I've seen so many people become inspired to cut meat out of their diet, just from this film. For me, I have been vegetarian (sometimes vegan) since I was 13, and I am hoping to become completely plant-based in the future. When I originally became vegetarian, I was not aware of the environmental impacts of animal agriculture. At the time, my love for animals was enough to discourage me from eating them, and I stuck with it. It wasn't until high school that I was made aware of how truly dangerous this industry is - for the animals, the environment, and for our society as a whole. The fact is that meat is not necessary to our diets, by any means. Although I completely respect everyone's personal choices, it is always frustrating to me when people act like changing their diet is impossible. So many people say they love meat too much to give it up, but, to me, it isn't worth the detriment towards our environment, or the pain caused to so many innocent animals. It is quite honestly insane to me that people justify the death and torture of millions of livestock just because they want to eat a cheeseburger. I feel as though we can't discuss this issue without acknowledging the fact that many people are not capable of living a plant-based lifestyle due to the cost or because they do not have a choice in what they eat. However, I think many people would be surprised at the affordability and versatility of a plant-based diet, if they did sufficient research. Although meat alternatives and other more specialized vegan foods are more expensive, there are plenty of fruits, vegetables, beans, grains, and other options that are filling, inexpensive, and much more fresh and healthy than meat. Ken, I am so glad you decided to show this film, because I think it does an amazing job of exposing an industry that should have been changed decades ago. I encourage everyone to do what they can to cut out animal products, whether that be just cutting out red meat or choosing to go meatless one or two days a week. I promise that, although it may not seem like much, it is one step in the right direction to better one's health and decrease the damage on our environment by the industry.

I also went vegetarian a few years ago because I watched a film very similar to Cowspiracy (I forgot the name). I totally understand how you feel when you said that you respect people’s choices to eat meat, but feel annoyed/mad when they believe that meat is mandatory in their diet. Honestly, I had trouble at first transitioning to a vegetarian diet at first because I had that exact same mindset. I grew up with my mom telling me to finish the chicken on my plate because it had protein and nutrients essential for my health. I guess the idea got ingrained into my mind. I didn’t particularly enjoy the taste of meat, but somehow, in the beginning, my mind craved it because it thought I needed it. However, I started writing how I felt each day (mood/energy level/hunger level), and I realized that I was doing so much better without meat. Through changing my mindset, I was able to go vegetarian. I think a lot of the people struggling with meat consumption just has to get through that initial mental part. 
<br><br>
I am glad that we watched this film for class, even though some clips were hard to watch. Most people have never watched or imagined what it’s like in farms, and they do not think where the meat that is perfectly packaged in supermarkets come from. Films like these should be broadcasted extensively and even in schools.


<br><hr>
I agree with this statement completely, although I have not completely cut meat out of my diet, I have tried to consume much less of it. While I was unable to make this change my best friend went vegetarian a few years back after watching this documentary. In addition, I in the past did not understand why people went vegan or vegetarian aside from the animal cruelty in producing this food, I never seriously considered the environmental impacts until more recently. After watching this documentary and taking this class I now understand how detrimental this is the global climate. 
                 <br><br>
Also knowing that first world countries waste such a large portion of food is frustrating because personally, in my home we do not let food go to waste. My parents are extremely frugal and have taught me to never let food go to waste and never buy more than you can eat. If the food is not finished at first it is recooked into another dish or fed to our dog if its safe for her to eat. Rarely does it ever get thrown out. When i was young my mom used to tell me to look at all the rice grains at the bottom of my bowl, and she told me to add up all those rice grains after a year and think about how many people that could feed. I truly did not understand the impact of that as a child but I am glad it is a habit I took up. When moving into college and at first witnessing my roommate throw out whole meals, it baffled me and made me a bot angry that they let all of that go to waste. Since then I was able to talk them out of throwing away food so irrationally and just to keep the leftovers for later.
<br><hr>
It was inspiring learning that you have been vegetarian since you were 13. There have been many times where I have considered converting to a plant-based diet but could not find the will too. But after watching this documentary and learning of yours and others stories, I feel inspired to cut meat out of my diet. Before this film, I did not know close enough about the devastating effects of the animal agriculture industry. It also frustrates me how stubborn people are to make such simple lifestyle changes- like eating less meat, beef especially. We don’t even need to cut meat out of our diets completely, just simply eating less is contributing to lessening our carbon footprints. 
                 <br><br>

Eating beef is not worth the cruelty animals go through and the damaging effects toward our planet. If livestock were all killed in humane and painless ways, then maybe I could justify eating meat, but expecting that is not realistic. All that pain that animals go through just so we can eat a hamburger. I do believe that transitioning to a plant- based diet is very possible and affordable. There are so many vegan substitutes and eating vegetables, beans, grains, and fruits is a much more healthy diet than one that consists of meat. I stand by your suggestion that everyone should choose go meatless certain days of the week. It may not seem like much, but if everyone collectively did this, we are taking a big step in the right direction.

I watched both films.
                 <br><br>

I didn’t find “Cowspiracy” as influential as I was led to believe it would be; I am already a vegetarian though I had never seen it before (partly due to it being based on a disproved statistic and partly due to me feeling it was unnecessary to watch after having been exposed to the horrors of agriculture and factory farming courtesy of PETA videos). My roommate told me she became a vegetarian after watching the film, so I assumed it would have a large impact on me. I was a little disappointed; there were some parts that didn’t quite sit well with me, namely Kip Anderson’s choice to go after what I would consider the “good guys” in the fight against climate degradation such as the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and the NRDC. Despite my being slightly disgruntled, I am glad the film is so successful in influencing people’s dietary choices! In fact, reading other comments on it is truly amazing to me. While I may not have been as shocked by the film, it is nonetheless a net positive.
                 <br><br>

One particular point in the film was an interview with two American farmers, a married couple, who when questioned about forest degradation in the Brazilian rainforests to make way for farmland, answered, “They shouldn’t be eating beef,” which I thought really exposed their ignorance; the high demand for beef that requires such clearing and cultivation isn’t mainly coming from the countries that have to farm it, rather from their beloved America and other Western and Asian countries.
                 <br><br>

The second film, “Wasted!” I quite enjoyed; the 5 levels of what can happen with food waste emphasized the importance of minimizing what we throw away. Some of the statistics presented here were simply jaw dropping: it takes 25 years for a head of lettuce to decompose in the landfill, 90% of the US’s food waste ends up in the landfill, 70% of grain produced in the US is solely for livestock, 10 million tons of produce go unharvested each year. However, the waste has prompted much creativity all along the chain, including using more of the plant that is grown (who knew cauliflower was so versatile?), supermarkets that recover and redistribute food, feeding animals (check out Eco-Feed’s website, it’s actually really cool: https://www.eco-feed.net/), using methane released by anaerobic food decomposition to create electricity, community gardens (which truly made grassroots movements seem plausible and was all-around very inspiring and adorable), and placing a fee on food waste. These were all amazing adaptations to the same problem, addressing it all along the food waste chain. Though there were a list of things that the individual can do too that are super easy and definitely worthwhile: http://www.wastedfilm.com/take-action/ .

Having watched “Cowspiracy” before, I watched the film “Wasted!” I really enjoyed this film because it not only exposes the horrific and irrational implications of food waste (1/3 of food grown is wasted in the world!), but also gives plausible and creative solutions to this problem. The film gives many appalling facts. One segment of the film that I found very interesting was when it considered waste in the fishing industry, giving the statistic that for every 1 pound of primary fish caught, 6 pounds of other species is considered “trash fish” and typically disposed of! Furthermore, the film shows how certain yummy fish are not eaten solely because of the name/image that they have with customers. As shown in the film, when these fish are given new names and served up nicely, they are actually quite tasty and there is no need to waste them! 
                 <br><br>

A great solution to the food waste problem I found in the film was Eco-Feed. As Audrey stated above, 70% of grain produced in the US is solely for livestock, like corn for pigs. Eco-Feed provides a great solution by using food waste to feed livestock. Grain monoculture agriculture is very detrimental to the land and the environment, and Eco-Feed not only provides a solution to utilize food waste, but also help the environment further by eliminating the need for grain fields that are so detrimental to the environment! 
                 <br><br>

These are just a couple of highlights from the film, which I recommend to everyone as it is a very educational and thought-provoking film that has great implications for our planet.


<br><hr>
I had watched "what the health" before Cowspiracy so I was left a little disappointed by this film too. I think mainly because What the Health had such a huge impact on me (the reason I stopped eating meat) so Cowspiracy didn't feel as eye-opening as I had heard it was. Although I was still shocked to learn about people dying who were trying to stick up for the deforestation of their land. The nun that was found murdered just because she was trying to stop the beef industry was crazy to me; I had no idea the matter was this serious and I can only imagine how scary it would be to make this film! I also watched wasted after watching Cowspiracy and I loved it! I mainly loved all the ideas people were coming up with to help combat food waste like the market, the creative chef, and the bread beer! I was shocked when the lady left the market with 6 bags of food for $39! It makes me think and wonder why other states and cities can't provide markets like these that help the community so much in terms of health and money.

Cowspiracy is definitely one of the stronger films that has been provided in this course--it's entertaining, eye-opening, and very informative from font to back. The one problem that I have with the film has already been addressed by Ken; his fact about animal production accounting for over 50% of carbon emissions is a bit problematic, and it can definitely lead to people dismissing the film's message overall as a result. However, aside from this, the film is great.

                 <br><br>

The film was very effective in communicating the message that the agribusiness industry is one of the leading contributors to the climate crisis. It did this by providing multiple reasons for its harmfulness, such as its usage of water, land, and generally painting out the un-sustainability of the average animal factory.
                  <br><br>
My response to the film was both intellectual and emotional; it provided a substantial amount of data that was enough to convince me that the agribusiness industry is bad, and also made me sympathize with creatures who are harmed directly and indirectly. I was considering going vegetarian since taking this course, but after watching this film I decided to commit to being a full vegetarian.
                  <br><br>
I learned that in the agribusiness industry, there are many more animals that are harmed by its consequences, in addition to the ones that are killed for food. Although the film has pessimistic moments when it feels like the human race is the source of all the world’s problems, I did leave the film feeling optimistic as the director chooses to end the film on a positive note, stating that there are options possible for changing the way we live.

I have the same problem with Cowspiracy, I feel like the wrong statistics diminish the integrity of the entire film. It is hard to believe everything when some statistics are so wrong you can't tell what is right. I had an emotional response to the movie as well. I can't believe that humans and the animals we own make up 98% of the world's biomass, while free-living animals only make up 2%. I was not surprised at this point either to learn lobbyists are hiding what is really going on. I also did not appreciate how the film just blamed everything on the human race, but liked that it ended positively as we have the power to change everything going wrong as well.

The film Cowspiracy shed light on how much waste and resource-intensive livestock farming is. It was eye-opening to see these stats (mainly how livestock uses 30% of the world’s land mass; 50% if we’re looking at just the US) show up in the film. I think Ken touched on this before, but I think that there would be a sizable reduction in waste and carbon emissions if everyone just ate less meat. While going fully vegetarian or vegan is unrealistic to many, if everyone just adapted their lifestyle to eat a couple meals without meat per week, we would see a difference.

I have to say I have some mixed feelings on the movie Cowspiracy.  In terms of what I liked about it was how they really put the extent of just how bad the animal agriculture industry is for our planet into easy to understand and process terms.  Seeing how so many of the environmental disasters we hear about all the time are not primarily caused by the fossil fuel industry, as I previously thought, but by agriculture was eye opening and changed my perspective on the most important thing we need to do now for our environment.  I also thought it was relatable how Kip at first tried to make his environmental impact smaller by doing things such as taking shorter showers, driving less etc before realize it was all a minuscule impact he was making in comparison to stopping his meat consumption.  The documentary truly did reinforce my new opinions on how the world, Americans in particular, need to drastically change our diets for the good of both ourselves and our world.

                  <br><br>

Even with the good parts though there were still several aspects of the film I took issue with.  The first and most reasonable complaint I would bring up is his misinformation, or distortion of some of the facts he presented.  As Ken said, he reported that the animal agriculture industry is responsible for 51% of greenhouse gas emissions when in reality it was only 15%.  That is quite the massive difference, especially when you consider that the 51% fact was the primary one he brought up in his interviews to throw a curveball at whatever environmentalist he was talking to.  That also segways into the second thing I didn't especially like about the documentary, his thinly veiled attack on many large environmental groups.  The interviews at points were frankly cringe inducing to watch, Kip very obviously going in there to attempt to call them out on the "cowspiracy' they were all buying into and expose their hypocrisy.  But frankly many of those organizations, although admittedly not doing nearly enough in the animal agriculture realm, were still very influential environmental groups that have done a lot of good for our world.  They probably know a lot more about the complicated world of political action on environmental issues, and realize that selective battles must be fought in order to get the public to not become desensitized to the issues and go the opposite direction of environmental conscientiousness.  Kip trying to discredit them, while preaching his own incorrect facts, only serves to allow anti-environmentalists to brand people advocating for agricultural sustainability as radical hippie vegans who's only goal is to force you to change your way of life and eating habits.

I completely agree with your assessment of the film. I think it’s vitally important to recognize and act on an obviously overlooked and neglected problem, the film should have presented its views in a way that doesn’t diminish or disparage the causes of other environmental movements. During the interviews, I got the sense that the interviewer was actively trying frame environmentalists as hypocrites. At some point, the film even indicates that a plant-based diet is a pre requisite for environmentalism. While I see that the film is attempting demonstrate the fundamental importance of ending the destructive consumption of meat, I don’t believe that this is the right way to do it. A plant-based diet does not conflict with the any other initiatives advocated by environmentalists. Therefore, it’s shortsighted to be critical of individuals who don’t prioritize a plant-based diet when there are many other sources and solutions to climate change. Even if this change is as important as the film indicates, it doesn’t mean diminish the importance of other changes and movements. Regardless of the delivery, the content of the film deserves attention. For a stop so opposed and stigmatized by big business, perhaps this topic needs to be conveyed in a way that’s provocative. It’s shocking to see the number of activists killed in Brazil. In order for that to change, the information needs to be exposed to society on a widespread level. Unfortunately, I don’t think this film is that medium.

I honestly found this film to be one of the most captivating documentaries I watched in both this class and English 22. When the filmmakers visited the Samuel J. Green School, I thought it was so inspiring that so much effort is put in from this school to teach children the importance of composting at such a young age. As the film explains, composting is such an easy and effective way to not only significantly reduce food waste, but to create a fertilizer that will aid in growing fresh produce. I appreciate that this film highlights the importance of educating our youth in a way that to them, eco friendly practices such as composting are as a necessity, and also just as a normal part of life. I feel that part of the reason we have yet to make significant strides towards reducing our emissions is because many of our parents raised us with the same ideology with which they were raised: that climate change isn’t something that will really affect us and therefore we shouldn’t be concerned over our carbon footprint. While the effects of climate change may not greatly affect our parents, we are and will continue to see them in our lifetime, and younger generations such as our own children will undoubtedly face monumental consequences if nothing is done. This is why educating children from a young age that not only is climate change a very present and dangerous threat, but also the various ways in which one can reduce their emissions. While there are more impactful practices one can learn other than composting, I think the way that the staff are teaching the children of Samuel J Green is something that should be adopted by all K-12 schools. 
                  <br><br>


I also really appreciated the way in which the film ended by outlining several very easy ways one can live a more sustainable lifestyle, by doing things such as planning out meals, making a shopping list, buying local and seasonal produce, using ugly produce, experimenting with scraps, and freezing leftovers. All of these things are so easy to do, almost anyone can do a few, if not all of them, without really changing their way of life in any drastic way. While we need to do a lot more than significantly limit our food waste, this documentary sheds a light on not only the harmful effects that wasted food has on the environment, but the countless ways in which we can completely eradicate this part of the problem.

 I very much agree, in comparison to something like project drawdown, there is a good amount of things that people can do in this case to reduce food waste, which I really like. When in this class we talk about big changes the world needs to make like keeping all the oil in the ground of completely changing the culture in which we live to be much more sustentable I feel like I can’t help but be a bit discouraged, because it is so hard for me to see that from being possible, because the few people that have power are unwilling to change and too few people are willing to want to make a difference. When it comes to smaller initiatives like wasting less food I feel much more hopeful. It is really good to see the laws in France and Italy about how supermarkets can’t throw away food, all these startups to use food waste to produce useful resources (in this case using capitalism for something actually than bad), and Japan feeding pigs what would otherwise be food waste, really shows the good that we can achieve when we put our minds to fixing a problem.

After watching the film "Cowspiracy", I feel the producer did a lot of researches and interviews regarding the environment issues. He showed people the problems of animal agriculture and overfishing, which is for reaching the purpose to appeal to people who wanted to participate in environment protection. However, a lot of organizations realized the issue that animal agriculture releases a much larger part of greenhouse gases into the air than human activities do, but they didn’t care or come out any measures. In other words, they didn’t want to change the current situation. Casual viewers, after watching the film, started to concern about the issue because they had never heard about it before. I feel paradoxical after I watched the film. One side of the problem is animal agriculture brings a lot of harm to the environment, the other side is people can not change their habits to eat vegetables instead of consuming more meats. Changing an eating habit is a large work, especially we have 7 billion of population in the world. I believe It is mostly impossible to achieve and people will get angry about it, so the organizations do not get involved to care about this issue. If I am one of the supporters of the environmental protection organization, I can’t accept the proposal of preventing to eat more animal meat, and I will probably stop to support the organization. Therefore, changing oneself’s lasting eating habits is much more difficult to change a daily habit such as turning off lights when going out because it is pretty influential, and the organizations didn't want to interfere in this issue. I feel pessimistic because we can’t solve this issue though we have realized it.

In my opinion, the film was effectively communicating it subject, because the film mainly was telling Kip Andersen who is an environmentalist found cattle footprint is the most severe cause of greenhouse effect.And he continued to connect with all the environmental departments and pointed out the animal agriculture need more attention, although most of departments avoid or not realize the impact of animal agriculture. I agree with you and I think casual viewers should watch this film. In the film we can see that many environmental expertise and ranch owners do not realize the severity of cattle footprints. Thus, most of casual viewers have a large possibility do not know the cattle is a lead cause to aggravate the greenhouse effect. My response primarily emotional hands down. I felt too shock and unbelievable after watching this film. Like other interviewees in the film, I cannot imagine cattle can have such huge influence on our environment. Forest destruction, polluted oceans and over-exploited oil or fossil fuel and so on, these are reasons that cause greenhouse effect everyone knows. But animal agriculture always is ignored by us. Animal agriculture is like a source of other reasons. The forests were cut down because of the development of animal husbandry. Irregular farm emissions can cause ocean pollution All these outcomes that animal agriculture brings will cause environmental degradation. After watching it, I feel a little pessimistic. Main reason is when kip had interview with some environmental department, they all denied animal agriculture is main point to cause environment get worse. From the film, now I know livestock can produce a large amount of methane that is harmful gas causes greenhouse effect. I definitely will recommend this film to my friends. Because Only when everyone cares for the environment, the environment can be improved. Maybe we can't do any grand things to stop some bad behaviors, but we can start from small things and be an environmentally friendly person who saves water, saves electricity, uses less disposable wooden utensils, and uses fewer plastic bags.

After watching this film, even while watching this film, I was frustrated and disgusted by how much knowledge big corporations had on the impact of the meat and agriculture industry on the climate, but how little they did in educating people on it or doing their part to stop it. These big corporations, who actually advocate that they are eco friendly, could have had profound impacts on helping combat climate change. Because these corporations are well known, they have a following and are able to spread awareness of the harmful impacts of the agriculture industry to a large number of people. I didn’t know how bad the meat industry was until watching this film. I knew that the meat industry was bad to an extent because people would always say that they were going vegan because of the environment and not because of ethical reasons, but I did not know how terrifyingly much methane was being released in the atmosphere due to raising cattle. And not only this, how much water and land our whole world uses that is squared away for the meat industry. Like all of the other films we have watched for this class, this one also has called me to action. I have decided that instead of saying i’m thinking of or trying to stop eating meat, after today I am actually quitting eating meat all together, cold turkey. I am excited to do my part in helping raise awareness of how bad the meat industry is for our planet while also contributing to saving our water and atmosphere in the process. Ultimately, I am mortified at how much I have contributed to the mean industry in my life, but I believe if we spread awareness of the deadly effects it has we can enlighten more people on the issue and drastically decrease the amount of mean eaters on this planet.

I felt the same way while watching “Cowspiracy”. I feel like the audience and the director of the film, Kip Anderson, share the same kind of frustration throughout the film. I still can’t understand why corporations who are supposed to be helping the environment are just denying the issue of animal agriculture all together. What are they afraid of? Is the cattle industry really that powerful or are most people just really attached to our food, like we are with stuff? What was really shocking for me was discovering just how harmful ranching actually is, aside from the carbon dioxide emissions it produces. The thing that really made me tear up from this film was the immense amount of animal cruelty. Watching the dairy cows be taken away for meat because they weren’t good enough anymore, or having wild animals shot and killed so that the animals would be safe, or watching that man kill those ducks was just gut wrenching. I rarely eat meat or dairy, just because I don’t like it, but every now and then I do consume animal products and after this movie I too want to stop eating them all together. What made me really think about this decision was when the director said, “If i can’t do it, I don’t want someone else doing it for me”, when referring to the slaughtering of the duck.

I've heard of the documentary Cowspiracy maybe since middle school, back then I came from a more republican, conservative family so really I was not interested at watching it at all. I didn't think I believed in the things they were talking about in the movie. After coming to college, however, I got a much more broad education and re-learned some important information I had previously discredited. 
                  <br><br>

After watching this documentary now I have a much better understanding of the climate crisis and the fact that it's actually a real thing, it is very urgent, and something needs to be done about it very soon or we won't have much of earth to live on anymore. The agriculture business isn't necessarily the problem. agriculture has been around for thousands of years and they have been able to do it now and in the past sustainable. The problem is the scale to which we are producing and the shortcuts we are taking to produce more products faster and cheaper.

I grew up in a similar situation in which many of my beliefs were inspired by my parents. Up until college, I didn't a have sense of what other students my age believed in in terms of the climate crisis as a whole. 

                  <br><br>

Of course movies made by these producers are funded by people with biased ideas, but data across multiple platforms suggests that the climate crisis has become an urgent problem; and with that, comes an urgent need to find solutions to not only reduce our individual carbon footprint, but make consistent plans and legislation to implement a large scale plan to reduce global emissions. This takes time to develop, but as we can see now, we don't have that much of it. Cowspiracy has a definitive mission to expose the issues with the food industry and the people's habits under the chain, and does a good job at posing questions that we all want answers to, but are never answered clearly. These underlying, yet detrimental problems, have caused an unsustainable food industry in which corporations are being entitled to compensation for funding an industry that's practices waste an unimaginable amount of food and pollute the environment with greenhouse gases.

<p>
The film Cowspiracy is directed by Kip Andersen that explores the impact of animal agriculture on the environment and investigates the policies of environmental organizations on this issue. In the film, the director Kip wanted to do everything he can to help with climate change. He started to separate the trash and recycling, took short showers, saving water and electricity, and road bike instead of driving everywhere. Kip was wondering if this is enough to save the world. Then he found out that cows produce more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector. The film also indicates that the animal industry is the leading cause of water use, deforestation, and ocean dead zones. I hadn't noticed that cows could produce that large amount of greenhouse gases until I took this class. Kip was also shocked by this fact. How is it possible he wasn’t aware of this? He went to the nation’s largest environmental organizations’ websites, surprisingly, none of them mention the impacts of animal agriculture on the environment. I believe until now many people aren’t aware of the fact that eating beef is significantly increasing their climate footprints. Sometimes, people aren’t acting not because they don’t want to, but they don’t have enough information and knowledge to guide their actions. Through watching this film, I believe our government and these environmental organizations should make more efforts in informing the public of the fundamental cause of global warming. Furthermore, giving out more specific and accessible advice that everyone can do to mitigate the climate crisis.

After watching the film Cowspiracy, I felt deeply moved and upset. The film is well made, allowing viewers in on the real life frustration that the main protagonist felt. It is jam packed with facts, never allowing the viewer to forget about the multitude of damages that animal agriculture puts on the planet. Although Ken reveals that some of these facts and figures are false, I still believe it is more impactful to have these statistics included. In the state that we are in with our environmental disaster, we need reactions from viewers, even if it is slightly exaggerated. Additionally, I felt upset with the response from environmental groups over the impacts of animal agriculture. We put so much faith in these groups to advise us, especially those who do not have a complete environmental education but want to make a difference. By completely omitting animal agriculture from the climate crisis, these groups are failing us. 
                  <br><br>
 While watching the movie, I questioned my own behavior and eating patterns. Although I consider myself an environmentalist, patting myself on the back for picking up trash and telling my friends how to sort their waste, I feel like I, like many others, often forget to think about the environmental impact of eating patterns. When eating , I often think about what will be healthiest, tastiest, most satisfying for me, not even considering the planet. I eat meat, not heavily, but probably more than I should. However, after watching this movie, I will be more conscious of choosing vegetarian options when walking around the dining hall.

your emotions following watching “Cowspiracy” mirrored mine exactly. I felt like I had been preaching to participate in numerous earth-friendly practices, such as recycling and thrifting clothing, while neglecting aspects of my life that make the hugest impact. While reflecting on my personal diet, I realized that I have become accustomed to eating without any thought at all. Eating a meal is such a mundane activity that I don’t even pay attention to the details. For instance, I can make small adjustments that would eliminate my contribution to the meat industry altogether: leaving the pepperoni off pizza, bacon out of omelets, and chicken out of pasta. I think it is just important for us with the knowledge to consciously practice tracking what ingredients go into our food, and the extent to which they are necessary and ethical. 
                  <br><br>
On the note of ethics, the depictions of terrible animal cruelty in the film broke my heart. I find it disgusting how idolized meat dishes are in our society, while the process behind it is so inhumane and inconsiderate. I can imagine that the rows of cows crammed into warehouses would not be such a norm if we hadn’t fueled its demand so heavily. Slogans like fast food restaurant Arby’s “We Have the Meats” are normalizing mass beef production and encouraging it through catchy phrases.

Since i have already seen "Cowspiracy", i decided to watch Wasted. It is actually insane that every year 1.3 billion tonnes of food is thrown away. That is one third of all food grown for human consumption just gone to the trash. I think as Americans we really do not understand the implications of food waste. Once we throw something away, it is out of sight and out of mind. We don't even bother to think about who has to take care of that waste, we just continue along with our days as we normally would and do not think of the aftermath of any of our actions. I thought the documentary was interesting and honestly wish it was more popular because it definitely changed the way I view food waste. Although some companies may claim that they are taking care of their waste in environmentally friendly ways, that could often not even be true. I believe that Bourdiain did an amazing job and the documentary gave numerous amounts of ways and methods that food waste could be reduced. I hope Ken talks more about the resteraunt industry and their contribution to waste in America

So I watched Cowspiracy... but I don't eat cow anyways so everything was just upsetting and unfair to me. And, as Ken said, a little exaggerated it seemed, so I am going to talk about Wasted instead, even though I haven't seen it, because I have some opinions to share. Food waste is... SO SAD. My restaurant throws out so much food after events, and even per table during a meal, and it is personally heartbreaking to me because during my shift, I'm hungry!! I want to save that food for ME, not toss it. Whenever I consider the grand scale that this occurs in, it makes me shiver. So much good food being wasted in restaurants alone, and then we consider bruised produce in grocery stores, dented cans, one cracked egg making the other 11 trash as well... What a non-resourceful way of living. 
                  <br><br>

Wasted sounds like an interesting experiment of chefery, reminiscent of chopped. But I wish it would inspire further action and ideas! Why not make reusable food restaurants common! Why not advocate for people to share, or reuse leftovers! Why not allow consumers to select their portion size! Why not create markets that implement reusing food before it becomes food that needs to be dumpster dove for! I love the co-op in Isla Vista and the freedom I feel as a shopper there. I love buying bulk foods and feeling like I have perfect and sustainable control over my food shopping. I love cooking all of my food to avoid supporting commercial food wasting. There absolutely needs to be a shift in the industry standard of the food we buy, because the waste that this standard is generating is not only piling up, but also killing off species and forests and leaving little room for the planet to heal.


<br><hr>
I also watched Wasted since I have seen Cowspiracy. It’s appalling that over 90% of food scraps and wasted food in the U.S. ends up in the landfills. But I don’t think it’s so much that Americans are not considering who has to take care of our waste, just that we aren’t considering the effects that chronic food waste has on the environment. As mentioned in the film Wasted, people need to develop the same kind of respect for the landscape as a carcass. Sure, some of us (but many don’t) feel bad for wasting parts of an animal. However, we don’t have this same connection to the produce that we buy and consume. When it comes to problems arising from world hunger and starvation, we don’t need to produce more—we need to change our relationship with food.

After watching cowspiracy I was emotionally impacted by the visuals and facts the director Kip Anderson provided for his audience. However, now that I know that he exaggerated some of his most important facts, I feel like his credibility has been undermined. Don't get me wrong, the film is still very effective in conveying other environmental problems associated with meat production, but it definitely seems more alarmist than factual at the moment.
                  <br><br>
In regard to wasted, I thought it was a well made piece by the late and respectable Anthony bourdain. In my opinion it was more effective than cowspiracy.

I agree that the film was capable of evoking a lot of emotion and sympathy from its audience,  which would ideally be any decent human being. I'm not at all saying that you're not a decent human being for eating meat, but I do think a film as informative as this one should definitely be able to make you simply think about this issue and at the least consider the effect of its consequences. While I don't expect every viewer to change their ways, I know that I can confidently say that I had a moment of self-review and reflection of my own dietary choices after viewing the film. I find it hard to believe that someone would be able to disregard information like this in its entirety.


<br><hr>
All in all, I quite enjoyed this film and hope to show it to as many of my friends and family members as possible. I more impacted and inspired to make changes to my personal life than any other of the films or articles viewed thus far. That said, I agree with you Michael in that I was quite disappointed when Ken pointed out that Kip Andersen exaggerated greatly one of the main points of the film: that animal agriculture contributes only 15% of emissions compared to the 51% statistic put forth by Kip. I don't quite know what to make of this lie, and I think it's rather unfortunate because it discredits and disvalues a film that was quite impactful in every other regard. I have to wonder if Andersen truly believed in this statistic at the time of production, or if he knowingly exaggerated to make a more forceful impact. I also question: if animal agriculture only makes up 15%, are fossil fuels making up most of that remaining 85%? I wish that I had a pie-chart of all the GHG’s with the numbers on exactly what the percentages really (TRULY !) are.





</span></div><hr>

<p>
I thought the film was overall pretty thought provoking and well put. However, the fact that the film has incorrect facts is concerning to say the least. If the core fact of the film that "animal agriculture accounts for 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions" is wrong, that makes me wonder how many of the other facts are wrong. I think Kip Anderson was really out to make some of these companies look dumb, which was also a bit concerning. 

                  <br><br>

The core message of the film, however, still remains. Animal Agriculture is a core problem in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and needs to be addressed. I thought it was pretty crazy how most of these companies seemed to "dodge" the question of animal agriculture. To be honest, it seemed as if they legitimately were not aware that animal agriculture was the supposed #1 contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. To be honest, I'm still not even sure if that is true. I can't really take any of the facts stated by the film as fact. But, I do know that animal agriculture is obviously key to releasing methane in the environment and it also takes a ridiculous amount of food to sustain these animals. The truth is that dairy farming and buffalo/cow farming is not sustainable in the long run. With the population increasing, the problem will only get worse. Personally, I think the problem wouldn't be nearly as bad if we just cut out dairy and cow farming. These are the main farms that are not sustainable and that are taking up massive amounts of land and resources. Even if I don't become a vegan or vegetarian, I will probably  stop eating dairy products as much or eat beef because of the massive consequences of these on the planet.

Something about this film felt "off" to me. It was very one-sided and the facts were not all correct. Anderson claimed that 50% of the global carbon emissions come from the agriculture sector, but this is not even close to correct. If he was so wrong about this fact and no on bothered to check on it or care enough to make a difference, why should I believe anything else he is saying. I kind of got the feeling of when Sacha Baron Cohen goes to conservative politicians and tries to make a fool out of them. 

                  <br><br>

While I did not particularly enjoy this film, it did have some good points. It was shocking to see many of the organizations try to claim they were "green" and even cared about the environment. It just goes to show how much many businesses and executives are in it for the money and seemingly nothing else. Another particular part of the film was comparing how much land would be needed to meet the U.S needs for beef as the land kept expanding across North America. Something I never really thought about was the amount of time and resources needed per animal to get it to the point it was ready to be butchered. That is an insane and nonsensical amount of resources needed to make just a few burgers...

I agree with your comment on how this film seemed off, especially in terms of the facts that were nonchalantly thrown around. I think that this film, Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret seems to be exaggerating the negative effects of food production in order to make an impact. While of course food production is not good for the environment, their claims that it has caused 50% of the global carbon emissions is quite far fetched. I think that this made the whole film less impactful for me as it is hard to believe anything that is said when the facts are so misrepresented.
                  <br><br>
Despite their lack of accuracy, I also feel that this film was effective at portraying their message that this animal food source is very impactful force on our environment. It's focus on the greedy business side of the food production industry is eye opening and really delivers the message well that this issue as a whole is only getting worse. The resource depletion and use was yet another key fact that caught my attention as I do not think that this avenue is explored as much as the emissions of food production, yet it is a very detrimental aspect of why this unsustainable food production is bad for our Earth.

If I’m being honest, I didn’t enjoy most of the film. It made me think, but only because I felt like I had to further research whether or not Kip Anderson’s statements were correct. He just didn’t seem very reliable. The other documentaries we’ve watched such as The True Cost and Minimalism deliver their messages in beautiful and touching ways while maintaining their sense of credibility. I thought Kip Anderson failed to deliver his message that way. I thought the film was tedious. I felt like Anderson was going to big organizations just to trip them up so they look stupid in front of the camera. I get that he wanted to show how people are ignorant and in denial, but he could've done it in a less obvious way. It was annoying and it made him seem immature. I also found it very funny when some organizations emailed him back saying they didn’t want to meet with him and he took it so seriously. He would jump to melodramatic conclusions and think that they’re hiding something, when really they probably just don’t want to talk to him or don’t have the time. If I emailed one of those organizations and said I wanted to have any kind of meeting with them, I’d probably get the same response. That’s just the way the world works. 
                  <br><br>

Also, I think Kip Anderson’s mistakes completely undercut him. Throughout the entire movie, I had a hard time taking him seriously and it’s almost as though I could sense the sprinkle of bogus. Nevertheless, the film inspired me. If they could make a film like Cowspiracy and STILL get backed by Netflix, anyone can! I’m motivated to make my own film, perhaps one for flying like Ken recommended!

I'm glad you posted this comment because I agree with you--the whole film was quite tedious to watch. I certainly understand that there must be some cultural shift in terms of food and the kinds of foods we eat, but I don't think this film was a great way of illustrating that. It feels like more than half the movie was him spewing out statistics (incorrect ones at that) and the other half was him jumping to exaggerated conclusions about the environmental organizations. On that note though, I do think these organizations act more like "businesses," after all they rely on their donors for a lot of their funding, and that may be why they don't speak much on the issue of animal agriculture. However, I feel that shouldn't undercut all the things they are doing for the environment. One of my biggest criticisms I had for most of the films we watched is that it's all mostly white people talking about first-world approaches to problems and if there are people of color in the movie their lives' (and suffering) are being exploited on film. My criticism stays the same for "Cowspiracy." The thing about the other films is that I at least was moved to an extent, but I honestly wasn't moved at all by this film--especially knowing that Kip pretty much based his entire film based off an incorrect, overblown statistic. I guess it could've been an effective use of that statistic in persuading other people to switch to a plant-based diet, especially if it was their first time hearing about it.

I strongly agree with your opinion. I also did not enjoy this movie because of several reasons, not only because Kip Anderson did not seem very reliable but also because his thought is ridiculous and exaggerated. At the very beginning of the film, he threw a massive amount of data at people who watched this documentary, and these data seemed reliable and persuaded me. However, as this documentary went on, Kip tried many times to ask some prominent organizations the question. This action is just like he wanted to make fun of these organizations and wanted to tell people, “Look! These authoritative organizations did not know the source of climate change too.” Also, the part that makes me feel uncomfortable is his logic chain. He inferred that there must be some facts that they want to hide just because some authoritative organizations or people did not reply to his request. This logic chain is not reasonable. What’s more, just like what Ken said, there is some data that Anderson used that is not reliable, which confused me a lot. For example, the green-house gas produced by agriculture is 15% said by Ken or 51% reported by Anderson. 

                  <br><br>

Nevertheless, this documentary still has some advantages. It reminds people there are some parts that we always ignore the question of climate change. Not only the car can produce a considerable amount of green-house gases, but also agriculture plays another significant part that needs to be solved. This data, no matter whether it is exaggerated or not, can alert people to focus on this problem. In a word, focusing more on this is harmless.





<br><hr>
I really agree with your opinion regarding this film.This documentary reminded me very much of a documentary called "What the Health" in that it introduces the viewer to the issue at hand with many accusations and displays information in an expose style of editing that sways your opinion, as long as you don't go out and research the validity of the claims afterwards. Both "What the Health" and "Cowspiracy" had some pretty good sounding pieces of evidence at first such as finding correlations between large corporation greed and environmental destruction but undermined these important claims by using questionable methods such as calling up companies and asking them the wrong types of questions or framing them in a bad light that didn't offer much communication from the companies' ends. To a viewer that wasn't paying that close attention, they would assume that a lack of silence on the other end of a company regarding such blunt questions equals guilt but honestly the narrator really was not doing a goof job personally at finding out the whole truth in a factual and mature way. It makes me sad to see because people watching this documentary would completely skip over the pressing issues presented by the documentary and denounce their validity solely due to the information's delivery.

I 100% agree with your consensus. He kept on bringing up the statistic (and based the majority of the movie around the statistic) that "livestock contribute to over 51% of total greenhouse gas emission", which sounds absolutely insane and terrifying, but when doing a quick google search, you find a severely contradicting claim that agriculture (which includes livestock) contributes to only 9% according to the EPA (https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions). After looking into this claim and furthermore curious on how exactly he got this number, I found this forum that perhaps gives insight into this question (https://metafact.io/factchecks/70-does-cattle-livestock-contribute-51-of-human-derived-greenhouse-gas-emissions). In short, he may have gotten this statistic by carefully and deceptively combining other statistics in order to get that number. With this in mind, and the overly dramatic (almost fake) tone, how are we supposed to trust any of the other statistics he brings up? I know from my own personal education on the matter that cattle and livestock are extremely detrimental to the environment, but I feel that when someone who knows nothing on the matter watches this documentary, it will do more harm in advancing the climate change agenda than doing good.




<br><hr>

I completely agree with your sentiments Leanne. While watching Cowspiracy, if I’m going to be honest, I felt bored and annoyed with how the film was organized and produced. I cannot remember an instance of Kip Anderson establishing his own credibility, let alone using more than just the Worldwatch study that claimed livestock are responsible for at least 51% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions to make his claim. 
                  <br><br>
The documentary fell flat for me because of how unprofessional I felt it was. I understand the issue surrounding the consumption of beef and how livestock industries contribute a great amount to global methane emissions, water use, and land use. Although, approaching environmental organizations, who blatantly state that they don’t focus on these issues, seemed to be a shot in the dark when looking for further information or professional insight. The documentary seemed to be more about exposing Greenpeace, RainforestWatch, NRDC, and other environmental organizations for whether or not they are willing to comment on environmental issues surrounding the livestock industry rather than convincing the audience why these problems are detrimental to our environment, what the destruction looks like, and what we can do to implement change, which would’ve been ultimately more effective in communicating each issue.




<br><hr>

I thought this movie was also a bit tedious, which made it a little harder to watch. But I feel like this movie also targets a very important issue that we all have to take into consideration. Eating this much meat is very unsustainable, and from some perspective very inhumane. 
                  <br><br>
It was surprising for me to see how much land and water cattle actually need, and how much of it later becomes harmful gases for the atmosphere. I could not have ever imagined that these consequences can be so harmful to our environment. Before, I used to think that beef production industries had nothing to do with the climate crisis, but after watching this movie I realized I was wrong. Unfortunately, beef industries are a big factor in any economy of any country, since they feed entire populations, and there is little we can do on an individual scale. In my opinion, governments should promote and help businesses that can support vegetarian and vegan diets, simultaneously reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released in the atmosphere. Only when such diets become popularized and encouraged we will have the change we truly need.



<br><hr>
I felt the same way while watching this documentary. Certainly some parts of the film were moving and inspired me to make changes in my life, other parts were tedious and could have been delivered in a much more effective way. Initially I was shocked to hear that animal agriculture contributed to over 51% of greenhouse gases, but then I quickly discovered those statistics were completely blown out. No wonder the representatives from the various environmental organizations were bewildered upon receiving that information.   While animal agriculture does contribute enormous sums of carbon emissions, I find it increasingly important to use correct statistics and information. 

                  <br><br>

Nevertheless, this documentary does discuss an important topic that more people need to be talking about and educated on. Switching to a planet-based diet and ultimately wasting less food and water can have a huge impact - I don't think people understand the degree to which this can help the planet.

The film “Cowspiracy” goes deep into exploring the reason why the world’s leading organizations avoid making claims on the destruction of animal agriculture. In the film, many of the well-known organizations declined the filmmaker’s request for an interview. Even among those who agreed to attend an interview, when they were asked regarding the issue of animal agriculture, their first reaction was to emphasize how complicated the issue of climate change was, without actually answering the questions directly. It wasn’t until later when the filmmaker learned that organizations were worried that bringing up the meat issue would hurt their fundraising. Then it was noticed that the fundings for the film was dropped. I am curious of how they eventually were able to produce the film, so I searched online and learned that the film was crowdfunded. Fortunately, the fundings were 217% of their goal, so they were able to produce the film with subtitles in a variety of languages.

I have never seen Cowspiracy, so I really did not know what to expect. Watching this film was definitely an eye opener, I had not realized how much cattle affects and contributes to climate change. I personally do not eat meat that often but not too long ago I went pescatarian in hopes of helping the environment but after watching this film it makes me feel as if I have done nothing to help in fact only harm the oceans. The only way to help climate change is to stop eating poultry, it is concerning that organizations that are supposed to be helping to fight climate change are telling us to eat more fish and are not saying that cattle is one of the main contributors. I cannot believe that these organizations are hiding the truth and that most were unwilling to have an interview when it would help people understand that meat consumption is bad for the environment. This whole film made me feel upset as if we have failed to protect the planet. For example, Dorothy Stang who tried to protest against deforestation ended up being shot and killed. People are afraid to speak out because people are dying and do not want to be the next one with the bullet to their head.

As we have discussed often in this class before, making a cultural change as large as completely changing our diet is difficult but vital. The film opened my eyes to the true impacts of red meat consumption. As we have discussed in class before, livestock methane production has a huge environmental impact. This film, however, made me realize the other ways livestock hurt our environment, from deforestation for grazing land to the fact that food waste leads to even more livestock being raised. I was also shocked to learn that food waste had a bigger impact than switching to a plant-based diet, as changing diets is something we have discussed far more than food waste. 

                  <br><br>

In response to the question about Anderson using incorrect facts, such as his stating animal production counts for over 50% of greenhouse gas emissions is very disappointing. While his numbers may sound more alarming and incite change, it is also disappointing to hear that he is spreading false information. If people are to fact check the alarming stats that he uses, it instantly ruins his credibility. This makes the film as a whole less powerful as people might throw out all of the information it presents.



</p><hr>


<p>

This film absolutely blew my mind and convinced me to go vegetarian. I honestly had no idea just how much of an impact avoiding meat could have. What truly struck me, however, is that the meat industry has so much power over our government, that environmentalists are being placed on terrorist watch lists. This seems to me to be as big of an issue as big oil’s lobbying power is.
                  <br><br>

While watching this film, however, I also came to slightly gloomy realization, one that Ken has been pushing us to come to for quite some time. Meat, cars, big houses, all of what is so truly terrible for our planet, are a large part of our national identity. We are going to need a massive shift in our culture.
                  <br><br>

This national identity surrounding environmentally destructive behaviors wasn’t inherited from our forefathers though. It was shaped by advertising. That’s the thing. These aren’t integral parts of our culture. We can still support freedom and justice and liberty and community and family and all the things that truly make America what it is without holding so tightly on to these irresponsible behaviors. We must start trending, as Ken has pointed out, to a cultural shift, and one of the first and most important places to do that is with what we eat.

The meat industry is a major money-maker in this country. It sickens me. I already have the hardest time convincing my parents that meat is bad, I wonder if we're able to achieve the massive shift in our culture we so desperately need. I have hope, though.

The movie Cowspiracy tells the effects that raising livestock has due to the immense mass of methane released, the water used, and the overall effect livestock has had on the climate accounting for all the animals raised. The facts that animal agriculture accounts for 15% of anthropogenic climate change and uses 30% of water consumed is truly astounding, give the number of people who still have no access to clean water, and the disastrous effects this climate change will have in the future. This value doesn't even account for the water polluted by livestock and runoff from pastures or pens. The argument for a meat based diet is a simple one. We have money and like meat, so we show we can afford to eat it often. Other than this reason, there is no benefit to eating a meat based diet that is not shared by plant based diets.
                  <br><br>
 A plant based diet also holds one major benefit meat will never have, it can save the planet. Growing more plants to eat not only can decrease greenhouse gasses produced by livestock, but can also help draw CO2 out of the atmosphere. Starting this movie I was aware that livestock was terrible for the environment, but I did not realize how bad it truly was for the climate. I already waste very little food, and intend to begin a switch to a more plant based diet to decrease my impact even more. I do not thing I will make the switch to a Freegan diet, but in some instances it may be cost efficient as well as environmentally friendly. I found Cowspiracy interesting and important to my development, but also saddening, as it demonstrates the point those in the past have allowed us to reach.

<p>
Regarding Cowspiracy, beginning facts caught my attention, specifically the true extent of how water is used. Apparently, 5% of water is for domestic use vs. 55% for agriculture in U.S. There is not a lot of information on water in regards to agriculture, but some examples are how 2500 gallons of H20 is equivalent to 1 lb of beef. Based on Home Water Works, a minute in the shower results in the usage of 2.1 gallons. Showering, which I see as a common way for households to waste water, is so little in comparison to simply one pound of beef! 
                  <br><br>

So much food wastes a lot of water. Cheese is 900 gallons of water; a burger is worth 660 gallons. What was shocking was how governmental officials in Sacramento refrained from wanting to include this kind of information, leading the movie to investigate environmental organizations and why these groups and people in power refrain from educating the public on these aspects. In the beginning, it was underscored that there’s a difference between water management and behavior change. This governmental official who pointed this out believed people would not care enough to change their lifestyle.
                  <br><br>

This is such a pessimistic thing to say, but it appears true quite frequently. However, by refusing to use his platform to publicly inform, his lack of action counts as negligence in my opinion. I’ve seen a lot of comments from this class that have said being in this class, learning more on the Climate Crisis from readings and lectures, have adapted changes. Several have turned vegetarian or vegan. Even I consider the solutions, such as living a more minimal life and purchasing a smaller space in the future. This is why I think education is important -- being informed gives others the knowledge and the ability to decide. I know a lot of the population decide on not voting or taking part in politics, but they should still be educated nevertheless to make their own decision and since their education would encompass the severity and urgency of the climate crisis, it could get them to act.
                  <br><br>

The movie did a fine job acknowledging that the world is definitely in need for people to collectively come together and make cultural changes, yet also recognized that people don’t want to be told to do. The reality is though that ecosystems are on the verge of destruction. It’s scary how Cowspiracy mentioned how the Amazon Rainforest could be gone within the next ten years when they were recently on fire. Rainforests are vital, yet are being cleared to graze animals and grow their food crops, despite how they breathe in carbon dioxide and release fresh air for us. Oceans too are being harmed and individuals are not taking precautions away from seafood. People need to come around and weigh their exploitation of livestock and the food they consume over the need for this common home, even if it requires noticing options that you like and choosing otherwise for the sake of our planet’s health.

The film Cowspiracy does a great job at exposing the animal agriculture industry and the impacts it has on our planet. The film's director included voices that are key in fighting for the environmental movement and give viewers more information regarding the animal agriculture industry and how it cannot be truly sustainable for the planet. 
                  <br><br>
With the different interviews that were included in the documentary, I did learn quite a bit about how many resources are used just to raise and slaughter livestock. Finding out that the statistic that Kip Anderson used about 50% of greenhouse gas emissions was incorrect, I think that his film lost a bit of credibility. However, because Anderson was not using himself as the only source of information, but was instead including interviews with experts in various subjects of the environment, I don't think that impacted his overall message. I felt quite pessimistic after watching the film because it's difficult to visualize a world in which the meat and dairy industry doesn't play such a large role in the lives of humans and the possibility of enough people choosing not to consume these products just doesn't seem realistic.
                  <br><br>
However, I think that because an inaccurate statistic was used by the filmmaker in order to make the argument, it severely diminishes the credibility of the argument and the film.



</p><hr>


<p>
Throughout the film “Cowspiracy” Kip Anderson conveys his overall message that cows are a big contributor to the exponentially growing climate change problem. He speaks with large organizations, however no one is willing to openly talk about it. As he speaks with major interest groups, such as Greenpeace, Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network, he learns that all of these interest groups are avoiding this topic because they fear of the backlash that they will receive from the farming community if they were to place blame on the cows for the several environmental factors that they are responsible for. Learning that these big interest groups have the power to spread this knowledge to thousands of people, but decide not to because they fear the backlash that they will receive upsets me. Our planet could be in much better shape if we would have all begun to understand the harm that our current diet causes. From the film we learned about how much land and resources we are putting into trying to maintain our diets, and from this week's reading we found out that we could all significantly reduce our carbon emissions if we were to simply switch to a largely plant based diet. If we were to all work towards having a few plant based meals a week we could not only be putting our land and resources to better use, but we could also be reducing our carbon emissions and helping our planet.
                  <br><br>
I believe that Kip Anderson using false statistics weakens his argument. The actual statistics are bad enough that he didn't have to exaggerate them in order to convey his message to his audience. Anderson exaggerating with that one fact, leads his audience to question all of his other points in his argument.

I find your comment very engaging because you bring up Kip Anderson using false statistics to weaken his argument. I also noticed this and felt the same way throughout the film. After the film I went on Cowspiracy’s website to read more of the statistics and it is true that the actual statistics are bad enough. Kip doesn’t need to exaggerate them because it did make me question his overall claim. It also made me sad to watch the Sierra Club shy away from this issue in the film. My family has been big supporters in the Sierra Club as they grew up in Northern California and would attend many of their events and donate. But since this issue is so crucial for climate change and to see the Sierra Club not take action for fear of embarrassment made me very conflicted and upset. After watching this and Ken’s lecture, I also can relate because I work at a restaurant where I constantly see food going to waste. I will see a huge tub of mashed potatoes, bread, butter, leftover fish, and avocado go into the trash. Everytime I am at work I will ask the chef if I can take home some, but he considers this to be theft. Very very strange. He cares so much about the food that he serves the guests and doesn’t think about it all going to waste.

Having already watched Cowspiracy, I watched Wasted instead and my gosh was that a wake up call. How is it that ⅓ of all food produced is never eaten when there are 800 million starving people on the planet? It angers me beyond belief. I hate how worried the US is about lawsuits. If it weren’t for that, supermarkets and restaurants could give their wasted food to those who need it, instead of just throwing it away. As it was said in the movie, there has never been a case where someone has ever gotten sick from eating old restaurant food, yet this is still a law, in part causing 90% of wasted food in the US to end up in landfills, which the EPA states to be the worst possible way to handle wasted food. In landfills, food decomposes in the absence of oxygen, creating huge amounts of methane, which is 23 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than CO2. I did some research and found that 11% of greenhouse gas emissions could be eliminated if food waste were brought to zero. How can we be worried about air travel, which only accounts for 2% of emissions, when we have this stifling number on our hands? I admit I had no idea food waste was this bad until watching this movie, but that angers me even more, because why isn’t this problem talked about? It should be a known fact. 
                  <br><br>

The one question that I kept asking myself throughout the film was how is UCSB dining halls dealing with their food waste? Everyday, I see students setting their dishes onto the carousel, many of those dishes full of wasted food. I looked into it and found that all the food that is left uneaten is composted. That gave me some hope and restored my faith in humanity a little bit. I’m proud to attend a school where environmental issues, and in this case food waste, are taken into consideration.
                  <br><br>

That being said, there is a larger issue at hand. Many countries across the world are starting to create new initiatives to reduce food waste. For example, in France, it is illegal for supermarkets to waste food. In South Korea, a new system was created where residents use electronic ID cards to open automated bins which weigh their food waste. At the end of the month, a fee is charged based on how much food a given household has thrown away. This system has already reduced household food waste by 30%. Today, Korea has eliminated almost all food waste from entering landfills. Yet, in the US, very little is being done. The average American family spends $1500 a year on wasted food, and one in five children in the US doesn’t have enough to eat. That doesn’t add up. We need to start doing more, because I feel like there are easy and simple things that can be done to help this problem. In the movie, they showed one initiative that is being taken, called Daily Table. It is a supermarket that sells the food that mainstream supermarkets are not willing to sell because of their look, which may not be “up to standard”. I believe this should be done everywhere in the country. It would be an easy way to bring that stifling number down. All in all, this movie did an amazing job shedding light on this horrific problem, but also giving solutions and examples of countries try to eliminate the problem.

I completely agree, it is such a problem and the US is concerned with other issues that are not even worth it.  I’m glad that UCSB does something about the food waste issue, but we as a country need to do more.  We have to follow the example of other countries now.
                  <br><br>

“Wasted!” was definitely an eye opening film.  The documentary really opened up the food industry and all the waste that it produces.  It is so sad that there is waste at each level of this supply chain from farm to table there is waste being produced.  This produces a massive amount of waste and in the US alone it produces $1 trillion in waste as 40% of all the food produced in the US is wasted.  That is horrifying.  To know that almost half of the food produced in our country is simply wasted, and of that 90% goes into landfills.  There, the trash produces methane, which is even worse, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions where there doesn’t have to be.  There is so much more that the food can be used for and absolutely does not have to be wasted.  It can be redistributed to people, be used to feed animals, and it can be used to create renewable energies.  There are endless possibilities with all of the food we have.  We do not need to produce more food as there are people starving in the world or without food, and we are here wasting our food, breaking down the global food system in addition to the fact that there are animals that are taking the food that can be used to feed humans.  Instead, feed all the humans in the world, then what food waste they have produced can be fed to animals such as pigs.  There should never be a reason that food is thrown into a landfill with all of the uses.  At the root of this issue is the food waste itself.  Since people typically don’t grow or make their own food, they lose that connection with it and therefore don’t really care if they throw it out.  In contrast, if people grow and make their own food then they build a connection with it and then are less likely to waste it, using all parts of the food.  This is important because we must also reinvent how we see food.  We must use all part of the food we have whether plants or animals, even using portions that are typically seen as trash.  We must maximize how we use ingredients to make food.  This in turn will also allow for people to spend less money on groceries and it decreases not only their environmental impact but also their personal financial burden.
                  <br><br>

This film inspires me to be much more sustainable with my food and really use everything that I purchase.  Typically in my family, as likely seen in other families, at the end of dinner if there is only a little bit of food left (“not enough” to save for leftovers) we simply throw it out in the trash can.  The film makes me rethink this and see how truly harmful and wasteful that is, sending my leftover food waste to landfills.  Just simple changes like composting or not wasting the food in the first place is amazing and can make a big impact.  I am inspired to be less wasteful with my food now.
<br><hr>
I think that your comment very well articulates the lack of effective government protocols/policies regarding environmental issues that we have here in the US, especially comparatively to those in other countries. I think that some of the initiatives you've listed from other countries would be taken poorly here in the states, or at least be met with a negative marketing campaign by politicians– I can see it now, "being fined for not eating the food that you worked so hard to pay for is a direct attack on our personal freedoms". 

                  <br><br>

That being said, I am super interested in the idea of somehow regulating food waste. Something I can vividly recall is the tv sitcom family dinner, where a bratty younger sibling doesn't want to finish their food and the mom says to them "you know there are kids starving over in [insert name of a country in the global south]" I think that wasting food is normalized, and it needs to be shamed in the way that people shame air travel in other counties. 
                  <br><br>


I also think that food waste is directly related to the disconnect between where our food comes from and our consumption. This film very well demonstrated that disconnect by showing the death of the duck, which even watching years after the movie made, not having any emotional connection to that particular animal, and watching through a screen I couldn't watch. I think that I appreciate not having to produce all of the food I eat, but it makes me value it less. And this leads to waste.

"Cowspiracy" was a very interesting documentary regarding how cattle grazing has become one of the largest proponents of climate change, and how much land the cows are already starting to take up. I actually decided to come home this weekend, and my family doesn't consume beef or pork, so when we sat down to watch the movie, they figured it wasn't applicable to them in the slightest. We also don't eat meat on Tuesday's and Thursday's, something that we've been doing since as early as we can remember, but when the environmentalist in the movie talking to Kip said that it's not okay to justify doing bad things just because you do the right thing once a week, I felt personally attacked. I think that part of our culture is engrained in eating eggs and chicken, and even that we're starting to stray away from, but I think that people ridiculing cow's milk, cheese produced from cows and even eating meat in general towards the end of the movie were being slightly unfair towards those whose culture simply revolves around these simple facts. Even then so, with the right education, I think that a lot  of people who have grown up in this type of society heavily revolving around animal products will be able to shift their views but I thought that the ridiculing towards the end of the film was very unfair. Aside from that, I think that it makes sense to at least raise the price of beef and other animal products, at least to convey that it's not an easy and sustainable commodity to consume beef especially at fast food places where a "quarter pounder" is considered a basic meal. I think that talking about alternatives to different produce such as replacing cows milk with almond milk is still going to be taxing on the planet though, since that milk also requires a lot of water to be produced even if it is plant based. Overall, I do in the end believe that the planet wasn't made to hold as many people as it does, and with the US having as much land as it does for such a little population and still not having the resources to sustainably produce beef, I don't forsee a future where places like India and China will be able to even think about this type of mass scale production of meat products. It simply will never be enough to suffice the hunger of billions of people.

I completely agree with your comment. My sister has been a vegan for six years now, and when I was younger, she showed me a few films that helped encourage her to change her lifestyle -- one of which was Cowspiracy. When I was younger, I didn’t realize how problematic the film was. While it is effective in scaring people away from eating meat, the holier than thou attitude turned me away. They mentioned that it was not possible to be a meat eating environmentalist, but I feel this did not take into account many indigenous tribes who rely on meat as the staple to their diet. Furthermore, food is not as accessible in many parts of the world, so making sweeping statements like that turns people away, and frankly, is quite ignorant. Another issue I had with the film is how it inaccurately portrays the facts. It’s important to go vegan, but by guilt shaming people with incorrect information is not the right way of doing so. The film did a great job at presenting a set of other issues that comes from raising cattle, like their intensive use of land and water. One thing I have learned from this class is how water intensive the cattle industry is. Eating one hamburger uses 2,500 gallons of water. When drought struck California, many resorted to using their grey water, not watering their lawns, and being more water efficient, but what I didn’t realize is how much of that water wasted solely went to making our McDonalds food. The film had many flaws, but it did cause it’s audience to think a little bit more about the foods they were consuming.

I thought that the documentary “Wasted!” was really interesting as it addresses something we don’t often think about in terms of the climate crisis: Food waste. Will 800 million people starving it is absurd how much food we waste in the US alone.    
                   <br><br>

One of the most interesting parts of the film was when they showed how much of common vegetables are edible. This has totally made me rethink my food scraps (even though I am an avid composter) as I want to do more with them before throwing them out. For example I can use stems and leaves of certain vegetables to make vegetable stock, or I can use the tops of beets in salads, etc. There are so many cool things to do with food scraps! 
                   <br><br>

This film has also gotten me interested in a Community based Agriculture Service or CSA for when I live off campus in IV next year. Basically CSA’s are local farmers and every week you get a box of groceries delivered. This not only reduces one’s carbon footprint and food waste, but it also supports locals

I also was super intrigued by the use of more parts of a vegetable than the norm. So intrigued in fact that I may have immediately looked up if the rind of the fruit I was snacking on was edible and tried it. (Experiment conclusion: orange peel, not bad. pomegranate rind, awful do not consume.) I fully plan on trying cauliflower leaves once my seedlings get larger. I love the idea of experimenting with "trash food" both because it's less wasteful and also because it's honestly just fun. It's a new medium to create with!  (Good lord, I just got distracted in the middle of commenting trying to figure out how I could consume banana peels) I'm always so glad when there are ways to help the environment that can be actually fun!
                  <br><br>
The fact that we waste so much food because it's ugly or odd or we just plain suck, when there are people starving is horrible. No one deserves to go hungry. In this world, highly processed unnatural foods are cheaper and in higher demand. I think we should all work to bring fresh food back to the front of American cuisine, and to the bellies of people who need it. (We got rid of jello salad, I think we can get rid of McDonald's too)


<br><hr>
I also found "Wasted!" to be compelling when thinking about my own food waste. Now that I have to buy my own groceries, I've started trying to eat every little bit of the plant I can. Radish leaves and other "root tops" are absolutely delicious in vegan pesto,  and the heels of bread really aren't bad. I thought the part of the film where the sandwich ends were thrown away was ridiculous. 

                  <br><br>

I think demanding local, fresh food is important in combating the climate crisis. The ideal "climate diet" is plant-based, minimal waste, and grown in our own counties, cities, and maybe even backyards. It's absolutely terrible that so many people, even in the U.S., have no access to nutritious, healthy food, and either go hungry or have to eat processed and fast food as their main calorie source. Adjusting our food system on local, national, and even international levels is vital to supporting human and animal welfare everywhere.

I really feel a little angry after watching the movie contract. So many organizations that threatened to protect the ecological environment didn't respond positively to the big problem of agriculture, even some people claimed that they didn't know about it. Although Ken later pointed out that the carbon emission caused by agriculture was 15% rather than 50% as mentioned in the film, it was also an amazing number. I was confused by the inaction of the major institutions in the video, and I thought about how to alleviate this problem. It's really puzzling. And I don't think vegan is a good way. Even if some people refuse to eat meat, beef burgers and other foods will be produced. If no one eats them, more of them will be wasted and cause more losses and problems. If my idea is correct, it should be so. So I agree with freegan. I think this is an effective way to reduce waste, rather than simply refusing to eat meat. But I still don't have a clue to solve the problem of livestock raising. I don't think the existing methods have very high feasibility.

Having watched Cowspiracy as well, I also felt angry about the lack of information that major environmental organizations had regarding the issue of eating beef and the agriculture industry. Like Kip Anderson mentioned in the documentary, there was no mention of how the agriculture and beef sector play a large part in this growing concern of climate change. You would think that as organizations dedicated to the protection of the environment and planet, they would pay some attention to this growing issue. However, they focus all their attention on other issues that are not as detrimental to the planet as the agriculture industry is. Some organizations were not even aware that the beef industry was such a large factor in the increasing rate of greenhouse gases being released into our atmosphere. What’s worse than not knowing were the organizations that were aware of this problem. If they did know about this issue, they did not do anything about it. Their inaction to bring change was what annoyed me the most. 

                  <br><br>

You’re right in the fact that even if some people were to give up beef at this moment and go vegan for the rest of their life, there will still be a demand for beef and other meat products. It is virtually impossible to get every person on this planet to give up meat and other animal products. Some people just do not care that their dietary choices are destroying the planet. Additionally, there are people out there that do not believe that cows and the methane they produce are an issue of concern, as mentioned by the couple featured in the film. They believe that their cows do not have a carbon footprint. Even if it were possible, it brings up the question -- What would we do with all the cows that were bred to be slaughtered for beef? They would still be releasing methane and we can’t simply kill them all at once. Thousands of pounds of beef will go to waste if everyone just decided to stop eating meat.

<p>

I hadn’t watched Cowspiracy before because of the known controversy, but I was excited to give it a shot for this class. I did, however, get skeptical when Anderson said that methane was 86 times as bad as carbon dioxide for the environment when we’ve been taught in class that it is 34 times as bad. Hearing Ken comment on the percentage of greenhouse gas emissions from animal production also being exaggerated makes me more uneasy about believing the rest of what they say in the film. However, I think they still bring awareness to many relevant topics.

                  <br><br>

I was shocked to see that organizations like Green Peace did not have any information on this topic and refused to have an interview, yet there were plenty of authors and academics who talked openly. It made sense when someone said that the organizations won’t talk about it because it will hurt their funding – that it was probably focus group tested and didn’t do well. This frustrated me a lot. I feel that food is something that is so personal to people and they do not want to be told what they should and should not eat. This is a problem that I do not know how to deal with. Several times my friends have asked me about being vegan and then say, “I could never do that, I just love meat too much.” Not wanting to start an emotional argument with my friends, I end the conversation. If you have an idea on how to talk about this topic with friends and family please let me know!
                  <br><br>

I think a major problem with the US obsession with meat (and food in general) is that there is a large disconnect with the consumer and where their food comes from. When Anderson saw the slaughter of the duck, he said he felt so uneasy about it that he couldn’t go through with watching the other one he had scheduled. Just the other day my friend was talking about a restaurant that has animals at it said that she, “wouldn’t want to see what she is gonna eat.” This made me upset because if you can’t even watch how your food is made, then you shouldn’t eat it. Similar disconnects happen with produce. Lots of fruits and vegetables at grocery stores go unsold and wasted just because they don’t look perfect. I think that if consumers were growing their own food, they would be proud of the lumpy potato they pull out of their backyard, but instead people expect commercially grown produce meet aesthetic requirements or it is unworthy of being eaten.
                  <br><br>


It also struck me when the topic of meatless Mondays came up. When one author said that when you participate in meatless Monday you only contribute to climate change and animal cruelty 6/7 days of the week instead of 7/7, I couldn’t help but agree. It just gives people a false sense of justification. This type of thinking is what makes me a little uneasy about Ken’s mention that food waste is a bigger problem. I do agree that food waste is a larger problem and I am not saying that a vegan diet is perfect, but why not advocate for wasting less food AND eating less meat? I feel that wasting less food while still eating meat is using the same sense of false justification as meatless Mondays.

I too spent much of the film wondering exactly how much of it was fabricated. However, while watching the documentary I discovered that it wasn't the facts and diagrams which stuck with me the most, but the visits to the "organic grass-fed" farms as well as the small-scale family owned farms. Watching footage of dead cows and ducks being slaughtered not only made me feel slightly nauseous, but it truly appeals to the emotional side of anyone watching who loves animals, or is a human being with a moral compass. I feel that if there was one part of this documentary that could convince me to become a vegetarian, it's the image of the slaughtering of farm animals without a second thought or hint of emotion. I agree that if you want to eat meat, you should be able to watch how it's made, and if it makes someone that uncomfortable or even sick to their stomach, maybe they should take some time to think about whether or not it's really worth it for them to be eating meat at all, as this documentary truly made me want to severely limit, if not completely take meat out of my diet.

When watching this film, I was reminded a lot about Catholic history and tradition.  For example, I attended a Catholic elementary school that was run by the Sisters of Notre Dame.  In the film they talked about the Martyr Sr. Dorthy Stang who happened to also be  a sister of Notre Dame.  This was someone I have always looked up to because I heard about her story pretty much since the time I could read. It is a shame that she was murdered while fighting for the rights of the forest and the indigenous people.  
                  <br><br>
I was also reminded of how during lent, Catholics usually give up eating meat every Friday.  This to me is a social policy that would be plausible to encourage our whole society to take up.  Let's be honest, it is silly snd irrational to be pushing for everyone on earth to eat a plant based diet.  It's not going to happen, as I, someone who care about the environment, can't be persuaded to give up meat.  On the other hand, I do give up meat on Friday's during lent, and I believe I could extend that out an entire year.  While not everyone would be willing to do this, I believe that this is a way for us to reduce the amount of meat we eat by 1/7th, and it 10% if Americans did that, that would be 35 million Americans eating almost 15% percent less meat.

I am glad you brought up the Catholic history and tradition. It is upsetting to see that people are harmed when standing up for something they believe in. I myself am catholic too and i'm glad you brought up lent because it hadn't crossed my mind. I think something that is encouraged in our society similar to giving up meat on Friday's during lent is 'meatless Monday'. What had me reconsider this idea of just giving up meat one single day was one of their statements during the film. They mentioned that we can skip out on eating meat one day but we'll still be causing harm by eating the other days of the week. It really had me question if that one day would even make a positive impact on our environment.


<br><hr>
I do all the Lent practices like giving up meat every Friday and it has never occurred to me that that could actually have a good impact on the environment. I agree that it is very hard to get everyone to switch to a plant-based diet because food is important to a lot of us and many people just grew up eating meat so it would be irrational to think they would just give that up easily. However, I like the point you bring up that we could give up meat on one day of the week. This is a good example of how we could be more environmentally conscious while also not having to totally change our lifestyle. I think the main thing that turns people off when thinking about changing their diet to help combat climate change is the whole idea of a "plant-based" diet when so many of us are used to eating meat. However, switching to a plant-based diet doesn't necessarily mean cutting off meat altogether. It could simply mean just consuming less meat and being more conscious of what you eat. Many times, we also buy way more food than we end up eating and this is so bad for our earth and resources as the documentary Cowspiracy showed. Little by little, we can implement changes in diet and food that will help our planet.

I have mixed thoughts on this film, which might seem weird or out of place coming from a vegan. I have actually never seen any films advocating for veganism, not because I don’t want to, but just because I barely watch movies. My choice to go vegan was mainly for the animals; I have a really big heart. I can’t stand seeing other sentient beings get hurt in the slightest bit (I even cry when I watch those wildlife animal shows on TV-- ew I am so sensitive). Secondarily, I am vegan for the environmental impact (this isn’t any less important than the animals’ lives, it just wasn’t the main reason I went vegan). Learning that I can reduce my carbon footprint up to 70% by going vegan was enough to feel like I am making direct change to the environment. I never went vegan for health reasons-- that is the least of my concerns-- but since going vegan I feel physically healthier and I have more energy.
                  <br><br>
Because of all of this, I did feel an immediate connection to Cowspiracy, because it spelled out a lot of what I stand for. But… I felt like the main guy in this film was a bad actor. I have a lot of training in acting so it might just be me overanalyzing this movie, but I felt like Kip had a lack of passion for the subject. If he did, he was not letting it show enough. It felt like he was reading off of a first-draft of a script and he was emphasizing the wrong words. I think if I was not already vegan, I might not feel a strong connection to this film at all. I also feel like Kip was coming from a very privileged white background (same with the guys in the film Minimalism) and he did not reference the intersectional parts of this problem or even how to fix it from an intersectional point of view.
                  <br><br>
I am definitely going to watch other vegan films to help educate myself on facts more. I did love the end of this film where he rescued the chicken! I couldn’t watch the part where the duck died though-- I had to close my eyes.

The documentary Cowspiracy illustrates the leading cause of several serious environmental issues: animal agriculture. The director interviewed people with different backgrounds, such as celebrities from famous organizations and common farmers. He utilized statistics and datas to clarify complicate problems. The combination of numbers and interviews provided the director’s main thought to the audience clearly. 
                  <br><br>
I feel confused after watching the documentary. Although Anderson made a mistake, the animal products still accounted for a large part of total greenhouse gas emissions. I was confused why so many organizations tried to avoid the huge influence of animal products. The film director Anderson mentioned the power of capital, which might influence the behavior of these organizations. I could not trust these leading environmental organizations as before. 
                  <br><br>

The most important thing that I realize is the terrible influence of animal agriculture on our environment. The avoiding attitude of environmental organizations made me feel pessimistic. This was because these organizations were aimed to protect our environment, but now they could ignore such a huge problem. As a result, how can they achieve their goal?

I have always known that plant based diets were something you could do for the environment, but I didn’t understand fully just how much impact this would make. I thought I was pretty well versed on what we as individuals could do to reduce our footprint but after watching this documentary it is clear that this is partially because these environmental orgainizations that I trust and look toward for guidance are against sharing the whole truth. I was shocked to learn the severity of this censorship, it being to the point where even the CEOs of these organizations sit and blatently lie in the face of contradictory questions. There is no way that they are so involved in the environmental community and don’t know about the impact that agriculture is having. But this dishonesty grossed me out a bit. 
                  <br><br>

I did, however, appreciate the brutal honesty of the producers of this movie. While they faced all these lies and cover-ups, they brought to the watcher the full ugly truth of mass food production. I was shocked to learn that 1 quarterpounder burger uses over 660 gallons of water - this is equivalent to shouwering for 2 entire months. This statistic alongside "we could feed everybody in the world with the food that we use to feed animals right now," shifted my perspective on the animal agriculture industry. So while, again, I did know about plant based diets and their impact, I didn’t realize the extent of the meat epidemic. Immediately following watching this movie - which truly shook me up, I had to go to lunch and immediately made the choice to eat tofu instead of chicken. It wont be a perfect transition but we need to arm people with the facts. Becuase while they know about plant based diets, they - like myself a few hours ago - don’t truly understand.

The film Cowspiracy made me really emotional. If I wasn’t already vegan, this documentary would have forced me to make the switch.  I eat a plant-based diet largely due to environmental and ethical reasons, and this film hit on both of those.  Even if not all of the facts were 100% true, I felt that the filmmakers did a fantastic job at presenting multiple sides of the issue.  They really tried to force meat-eating to be sustainable, looking at mass slaughterhouses, backyard farming, and even dairy farms.  Time after time, they car to the conclusion that animal protein will never be as sustainable as plants.
                   <br><br>

As far as the ethical part of this film, during the slaughter of the duck I had to both mute the film and turn around as to not see it.  Kip’s reaction was similar to how I feel many audience members felt during those scenes.  I resonated with his statement, “If I can’t do it myself, I don’t want anyone else doing it for me.”  I even laughed in the next part when he saved a chicken who was not producing as many eggs.  I felt this was a good way to emotionally relate to the audience, forcing them to see exactly what happens for them to get the food they love to eat.

I’ve always said that I would never, ever become vegan, and this film has definitely made me reconsider. I’ve already given up eating beef because of this class, and it was way easier than I had thought it would be. I still eat pork and chicken, and maybe in the future I will slowly cut them out, but I’ve also been drinking oat and rice milk for a while now and do not miss cow milk. I think I should start buying vegan cheese and eggs made out of plants, but for now I’m proud of myself for cutting out beef and milk, even though I know I can do more.  
                   <br><br>

The duck slaughter was disturbing to watch, but like a car crash I could not look away. Kip’s reaction also felt similar to how I did, but I’m just not at that point where I can give up all meat yet. I do hope to start trying alternatives, but one problem I have is that all meat and dairy alternatives always cost more, which may seem like a trivial price difference to most people, and it’s definitely worth it for saving the planet, but I grew up trying to save money wherever we could, so I hope in the future these alternatives aren’t as costly. 
                   <br><br>

I wrote down almost all of the statistics Kip spit out, but now knowing that he was wrong about the 51% statistic, and instead animal production causes 15% of global greenhouse emissions (which is still very large) makes me want to delete all my notes. I still very much enjoyed this film, but his inaccuracies definitely taint his credibility.

<br><hr>
Cowspiracy really did a good job in appealing to the audience's emotions, presenting both environmental and ethical reasons for audiences to switch to a plant based diet. If I also wasn't already vegan, Kip Anderson would have definitely made me reconsider my life choices. Although in the past I've been annoyed at people who avoided taking steps to become more sustainable by making excuses to why they can't reduce their animal product intake, watching Cowspiracy reminded me why it's easy to fall into that trap. Although the number of vegans and other sustainable diets have been increasing exponentially since 2014, the number is still in the minority. Since food is a huge part of our lifestyle, culture and identity, I guess it's harder for some to abandon something that has been a huge part of their life. Additionally, like Kip mentions, the meat/dairy industry, much like the Heartland Institution and the tobacco industry before it, has enough influence to trick environmental and (in his What the Health documentary) health organizations to go against science to purposefully misinform the public. That makes it all the harder for the general public to find the inspiration to switch to a plant based diet. However, I do find it inspirational that despite the meat industry's efforts, awareness has been spreading largely due to the efforts of activists like  Kip Anderson. Even if they're not fully vegan, the number of people willing to minimize their dairy or meat intake has been increasing as a result.

It was frustrating to watch "Cowspiracy" and see the people who claim to be environmentalists, not admit that the meat and agriculture industry are the number one issue that needs to be addressed. They know that it is risky to admit that people have to make changes to their behavior because the meat and agriculture industry are both very powerful. It's so dangerous to speak out, that Kip was even worried about putting out the film. He even mentioned how a Brazilian activist was shot and killed for speaking out against the meat industry. 
                   <br><br>
Another issue that was brought up in the film is the fact that we are so detached from the food we eat that we do not even give it a second thought to think about where it comes from. I am guilty of this, as I am someone who loves to eat meat and yet I am an animal lover. I would not be able to kill an animal and eat it, especially if I raised it. But then how am I able to justify the meat I consume? I just don't think about it, but we need to start being more conscious of the decisions we make because the world does not revolve around humans. The clip of when they showed them decapitating the duck was very hard to watch; i had to pause and give myself a second. How can we justify taking an animals life to eat them and satisfy our cravings? Worse yet, we aren't just killing them to feed us but we are reproducing more animals in order to kill them and eat them. We do not even give them proper lives and we are killing ourselves and the Earth keeping up with meat consumption. 
                   <br><br>
The film also did a great job at putting things into prospective with their use of statistics.  Some examples that really stood out were:
                   <br><br>
One hamburger water intake equal to taking 2 months’ worth of showers
                   <br><br>
Domestic water use only 5% of what is consumed in the US vs 55% used on animal ag
                   <br><br>
2500 galloons of H2O = 1lb beef = 30 lbs of lentils
                   <br><br>
660 gallons of water for one burger

"Cowspiracy" really opened my eyes as well and how completely corrupt the food industry truly is. I was completely surprised by how much water it took for livestock, however, I was quite tentative to how accurate it really is. Although I am a vegetarian and do not consume animals and completely agree that animal-food production costs a big toll on the environment, I thought this film was a little exaggerated in order to transition people to stop eating meat. I am not saying that it is anyway a bad thing and I think it is important to have a call of action. However, I believe this film was a little bit dramatized in order to convince more people. By all means, it still convinced me and after watching this I want to limit my intake of dairy alongside not eating meat. I believe this film is very important to watch to understand the corruption of all of these programs that are thought to help the environment while truly they are really a coverup.

The film was effective at communicating it subject. Through the investigation of a large number of organizations and various aspects, it explored the theme -- animal husbandry is the primary element affecting global warming and damaging the environment. The government and environmental protection organizations should watch this film. Most people deny that animal husbandry is the main factor. They believe fossil fuel is the primary factor. I admire the author's courage and agree with his opinion. Also, I gain a further understanding of the factors that lead to environmental pollution. I think more people need to be fully aware of the environmental impact of animal husbandry and other industries and make their own efforts to do so. I realized that in addition to fuel and other means of transportation, animal husbandry has a great impact on the environment, land resources, nature, water resources. It has also aggravated the damage to the environment. This film changed my understanding of environmental destruction and made me worry about the current environmental situation. But I also think when more people know and understand this problem, the environment we live in will be greatly improved.

The film “ Cowspiracy” might not be the most intriguing video but it is very interesting in the way that the agriculture industry is the second most harmful factor producing greenhouse gases to our environment but yet it doesn’t receive much consideration. I believe that this video does a great job of informing people about changes that need to be made in order to decrease the production of CO2 and other emission gases produced by cows and the waste of food. The gas produced by cows known as methane is way more destructive than CO2 on a 20-year time frame and this is worrisome because most of our meats and dairy products come from cows. As mentioned in the film cows produce 150 billion gallons of methane per day and therefore US methane emissions from livestock and natural gas are nearly equal. Meaning that we humans consume a vast amount of meat and dairy products that are destroying our planet. In order to reduce the damage we are creating we need to switch to a healthier diet consuming less meat and trying alternatives to dairy products. For instance, one might switch from regular cow milk to almond milk or vegan cheese. Switching to a plant-based diet is the ultimate goal but taking small steps will also help make a change. Like professor Ken mentioned before 1 pound of meat produces the same amount of emission gases as  30 pounds of lentils, therefore, we should all consider a plant-based diet not only is it good for the environment but it's also better for our wellbeing.

What I found most interesting about Cowspiracy is the emphasis on behavior vs. government policies. Like the documentary notes, changes in individual human behavior such as taking shorter showers or using more water-efficient appliances can only account for so much. Like many others have noted, individuals can only do so much against corporations. The fact that the agricultural food industry plays such a large role in our current global economy just showcases how powerless individuals are. It is no longer enough for one person to make little changes in their lives. There needs to be major changes in the larger government levels and an increased emphasis on holding these organizations accountable.

I also find it interesting that the documentary chooses to focus on other types of animal agricultural industries such as fishing because the audience sees the damage to these populations on more than just an environmental level. By providing those statistics about the fish and shrimp populations, the audience sees how much strain is placed on these animals by their eating habits. While the focus of the documentary is the beef industry, by contextualizing the food industry in a different area, they build an argument against food agricultural industries as a whole.
                   <br><br>
However, like others have noticed the fact that the documentary misreports their fact of 15% to 51% really makes me question the legitimacy of the rest of their statistics. While I do agree that it is important to educate the general public on these environmental causes and animal agriculture changes, I find that it is far more important to do this correctly. While I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they just had false information. Part of me is concerned that they intentionally misreported this fact to make their documentary more persuasive. Effectively undercutting their argument for the sake of a scare tactic. This problem is already important enough without changing the facts and I feel the documentary loses credibility with this mistake.

I completely agree with your argument, the fact that the documentary does not have accurate information as you would initially expect it to have because a documentary is based on months worth of research is almost concerning. Everything that was sad is than questioned because if they included one false information what is to say they did not do it multiple times throughout the film. Thereby the success of the film to help the public realize the horrific consequences the agricultural as well as the beef and fishing industry is having on our climate is then undermined with this uncertainty.

I find myself having similar viewpoints that you commented down about the film, Cowspiracy. Beginning with your view on how little the act of an individual plays a somewhat small role considering how much harm these big corporations are doing. Although working on your own carbon footprint and environmentally friendly approaches to everyday things in life is important, it is also not enough. There is not much competition when comparing individual behavior with the roles of large companies supported by government officials who do not seem to pay much attention to the damage they are causing. I could not have agreed more with you when you said, “it is no longer enough for one person to make little changes,” because it truly is not. We as a planet have gotten so deep into this climate crisis without any major political action to combat this tragedy. The fact that this issue is still a debate regardless of the scientific evidence is quite aggravating to me and furthers my beliefs that major political reformation must occur in order to save us. The animal; agriculture industries are ones that are not being properly managed as the documentary showed us many statistics about the environmental damage being dealt as these industries have no consequences for their actions. Like you mentioned it is much more than just the beef industry as many other food industries are also exploiting their practices and negatively affecting the environment and animal population. Lastly, I want to say I appreciate the approach you took regarding the mistaken statistics. On an issue that is already so controversial it is important to maintain your credibility and making a mistake definitely can hurt your argument. It would be very difficult to take any of this film seriously if they were using a scare tactic to be persuasive in the way they did. Inaccurately distributing data in such a way on purpose is unacceptable and can only hurt your argument.

I completely agree. Large corporations are ruining our environment for their own profit. Even if we all conserve water at our homes, we are no match against corporations. I also believe that in these cases, individuals are powerless. I think they did a great job of exposing the food industry as a whole, and not just sticking to cows. Cowspiracy was a shocking film, and I am so glad that I watched it. 
                   <br><br>

It is so shocking that there are 70 billion livestock animals raised on earth. That fact makes me not only sad, but deeply disappointed with where our society's priorities are. The fact that we can feed billions of cattle but humans are still starving is disgusting. The fact that people care more about their right to a burger than saving the climate is just as horrifying. Also, the scene of the duck getting its head chopped off with an axe was brutal, to say the least. I just down understand how people can kill innocent animals and not feel a twinge of regret. 
                   <br><br>

The fact that cows milk is made to make calves into 400 pound cows really put milk into perspective for me. I made sure to tell my friends who got dairy items this at dinner. Physician Dr. Michael A Klaper calls it “baby calf growth fluid.”

We need to waste less food. I was glad to hear the term “freegan.” Although the idea isn’t glamorous, I am very glad to see that people are doing this to help others, and standing up against the norms of society. It is also, I agree, a great disappointment that they reported a false statistic because it takes away their credibility. Climate change deniers and other people of that sort have ammunition against Cowspiracy and its makers, because of a falsely reported fact. However, I am so glad that I watched this film. The examples they gave of how to change my lifestyle I will implement immediately.



<br><hr>
I also have similar views with you on this film. It is hard for me to try and do things on my own to help reduce climate change when the things I do to reduce my carbon footprint are so easily masked by the beef industry. To have one person do something to reduce their waste a little does not apply enough to dealing with the whole issue of methane issues for instance. The people have to be willing to organize and come together genuinely with large scale effective tactics to deal with the government and how they can be involved with regulating beef production. To give insight on fish and shrimp populations is important because it shows how widespread the problem is with the beef industry. You make a very good point about how the misinformation that is reported in this document. I find it very distressing that so much time and effort was put into this documentary to expose the beef industry for what it truly is, just to stoop to their level of misinformation as well. It makes me feel uncertain as to what else is not true in this video. Besides this, diet will be our biggest way of dealing with the beef industry. If we try alternatives to food and force the beef industry to invest in other viable long term food sources, we can hopefully bring the market for beef down so they will no longer feel the need to expand and destroy areas for land.

I really like how you explained the individual vs. government argument. For the longest time, I have always been at the forefront of implementing small changes in my life in order for there to be a much larger domino effect. I was always told from a very young age that something so small can go to become something so large. However, quite frankly I'm starting to slowly lose belief in that statement. If I reduce my meat consumption by a large amount but then you have others who carry on eating meat to such a large extent, my immediate effects would've been mitigated right?  Individuals can go through such extreme changes in order to benefit the environment yet if you have a collective group of people who carry on depleting those aforestated changes then honestly what is the point? This can be likened to the statement of one step forward, two steps backward. I think it is absolutely imperative that the government intervenes. A great step in that direction was proposed by Barack Obama with the cap and trade policy. I strongly believe that this policy should be upscaled throughout the globe. Furthermore, the biggest problem in marketing is asymmetric information and so when Cowspiracy provided false information it really made me question the integrity of the filmmakers. As you mentioned, there's a great loss of credibility due to the misinformation provided.

Learning about the carbon footprint in agriculture was interesting because it makes you think of the whole process of resources that are used when raising cows. I sadly feel pessimistic after watching this film because as the population grows, the agriculture industry will grow as well. As it was said in the film, it is very difficult to change behaviors and eating habits. Even though Kip used incorrect facts, it did not change my attitude towards the facts. Whether it is fifty or fifteen percent of greenhouse emissions, our environment is still in great danger. I think Kip's documentary showed enough about the impact of agriculture and showed that real action needs to be taken in the agribusiness, not household changes. Seeing how different people had different reasons behind emissions that did not involve animal agriculture at all surprised me. People who should be aware of the greatest cause of emissions are only able to spew out facts about oceans and household actions. It shows that it is a major problem that needs to be talked about more. If the environmentalists themselves are not mentioning the livestock issue, how is the general public supposed to act as well? The livestock issue and climate crisis as a whole need more attention. “We are the weather” simply means to me that we are killing ourselves. We are causing the climate crisis through our own actions.

I totally agree with you. After hearing Ken explain that agriculture emits 15% of greenhouse gases and not 50% as Kip Anderson claims in his film, does not change my mind on how urgent this issue is. I’m not even upset that Anderson exaggerated the percentage, on the contrary, I’m glad he did because this way people will start to pay attention and figure that there’s something wrong with our eating habits. I have considered transitioning into being vegetarian then into vegan, but I always put it off since I think I would face many struggles in my daily life just to eat something. However, watching all these innocent animals being slaughtered just for the pleasure and luxury of eating meat, pushed me to make a change in my diet slowly but surely. It is unfair that animals such as the ducks that were raised in a backyard, to get used to the person who feeds them just to get killed by that same person. If humans want to eat meat so bad why not eat other humans? It’s still meat right? Can help with overpopulation right? Oh, we shouldn’t because it’s wrong, humans are breathing and living, and humans have a life? Wow, you won't believe what animals do! Live and breathe the same as humans. As a statement in the film declared that we shouldn't call ourselves environmentalists if we’re not one, since we’re still eating animal products. We want to say that we help our earth in many ways, yet when we actually have to “sacrifice” a piece of us, all of a sudden no one can do it.

Ken mentioned in his video that the narrator of “Cowpsiracy”, Michael Klaper, used an incorrect statistic regarding the proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions that animal production is responsible for. Rather than the correct statistic of 15%, he instead stated that it was responsible for 50%. With such a large difference between the two values, it makes it seem as if Klaper presented an overly drastic statistic intentionally. If the values were more similar, it might seem like more of an error, but this is just simply a tool of manipulation. By exaggerating the responsibility of the livestock industry, it helps him create this atmosphere of urgency and definitely sways the reader to take part in his frustration that many environmentalists groups fail to talk about this issue. It’s extremely unfortunate that he incorporated incorrect statistics because it forces him to lose some credibility, and thus the validity of his entire argument gets put into question. 
                   <br><br>
That said, I still feel that the meat industry occupies a large role in causing climate change, and I support the documentary’s overall conclusion that reducing our meat consumption enables the planet to be much better off. When taking into consideration the number of resources, including water, grain, land, energy, and workforce, dedicated to the meat industry, it’s obvious that it requires an incomparable amount against just growing vegetables. Much of the grain currently grown in America isn’t transformed directly into something that humans can eat, but rather it’s collected in bulk by animal farms so that the livestock can be fed. Then that grain is consumed and eventually repackaged in the form of cow meat that we buy off the shelves at our grocery stores. With this method, we’re actually losing possible consumable energy by feeding grain to the cows rather than to us. To me, this doesn’t seem like the best system for a human population where millions of people don’t have access to enough food.

I too was incredibly surprised at the vast statistic change. If someone is going to claim to help the planet, why would the difference be so drastic? I believe that it was somewhat intentional, but also a poor judgement on his part. he claimed to be this big environmentalist that redirected his whole life for the sake of the planet, but could not adequately research a major statistic that made the most impact on his film. The giant statistic of animal production constituting over half (51%) of greenhouse gases on Earth made me want to stop eating meat in entirety. During the movie, I thought I was apart of this huge problem and felt at blame that I didn't try to cut out meat from my diet earlier, when in reality, it was all wrong. His credibility was lost and I thought back onto the movie and wondered what else was incorrectly stated. But although his exaggeration was strong, it is a vital part in the future of our planet. If incorrectly stating statistics about normal everyday behavior is what causes people to change (I, for one wanted to, and I am definitely a meat eater and haven't touched a vegetable in years) then so be it. This urgency is what we need to combat climate change, and even I didn't watch Ken's video and know about the wrongly stated statistics, I would have immediately tried to make a change. But then again, he was wrong at such an incredibly drastic level that it makes it hard to want to change something you've been accustomed to doing.

The fact that taking these actions on the account for one second of driving flabbergasted me. It shows terrible cars are for the environment. I found it especially important how can, and the article highlighted that we must understand how little or how much impact something has. I look at it almost in an opportunity cost manner. If you could Drive less by buying a bike instead of by energy-efficient lighting for your whole house, it would be better to take the bike. I think it is essential to teach people to focus on what has the most significant impact. Once we have that sorted out, we can focus on all of the things, but we must stop the continuation of climate change before it’s too late. I also think that waiting for some big company to come up with technology to fix everything is ineffective. First of all, it might not be as effective as we think you well and we don’t have time on our hands. We must take care of this issue today. It’s also fascinating that I am a family waist 35% of the food. I think it is because of the culture that waste won’t affect Their income, so why should they care. I also find it essential to educate women and children in reproduction. This can bring down the population having a large and back and kind of change. It will free up extra land, housing, less food, and many other things. Overall I appreciated this article.

I watched the documentary “Cowspiracy”. At first I was kind of bored not going to lie. Then it got interesting though and I really got into the documentary. It was hard to watch near the end. I had to close my eyes at some parts especially the duck part. It made me tear up a little. It was crazy to me what Oceana had to say because I have followed Oceana for years and looked up to that company. I didn’t realize their views were so impaired. Also, some of the people in this film made no sense to me. “I love animals, which is why i’m in the meat industry.” If you loved animals wouldn’t you try to be an activist for them and fight for their lives?? I’m confused by that. Also they way ended the film was so powerful, it honestly really moved me by the statement that they said. I really liked this film it made me want to go vegan/vegetarian. I am going to try to start leaning towards doing that now because i’m so disturbed by what I saw.

Me too! And what I found it interesting is people in his status are actually hiding the truth of climate changes. Such as the issue caused by animals. Overgrazing is the worst action caused by humans. However, activists were killed by people who wanted to defend their profits. And when the producer went to some companies and wanted to ask about this issue, nobody wanted to willingly answer this question is mostly caused by animals. As an animal lover, i will also try my best both emotionally and logically.

After watching both "Cowspiracy" and "Wasted," I learned that the American government is manipulating the brains of many Americans in regards to the agriculture industry and the consequences of food waste. The American government manipulates the audience by influencing the people to ignore the operation of the agriculture industry. Also, they prevent all of use from realizing how significantly impactful food waste is to our environment in a very negative way. The majority of food waste that is imposed on our environment ends up becoming decomposed and instead produces methane gases, which is very damaging and harmful to the planet. Our ecosystem and the entire planet could be in danger if scientists and other people don't address and take action for the consequences that are brought upon by all the food waste. All of these phenomenons show how the American government is completely ignoring the responsibilities and how they are manipulating the situation to their own selfish advantages. These films should the reminder that tells all of us that our society should be able to afford certain solutions to this problem.

For the most part, the film was effective in communicating the subject of the detrimental effects animal agriculture has on our society. Anderson relied solely on facts sprung up by deep research and used imagery to entangle his points to a grander scale. By showing the hesitant responses in interviews from major environmental organizations, we are able to see that animal agriculture is destructive in our society and people are hiding that fact in order to keep themselves away from the repercussions of exploiting this truth. Greenhouse gas emissions are a critical problem in why global warming exists, which was clearly shown through Anderson’s research. This film was one of the reasons that helped me understand why I should be involved in a plant-based diet: I am now vegetarian 
                   <br><br>


The fact that people understood the problem of a grand cause of greenhouse emissions and global warming and were ignoring the fact or hiding it, made me truly upset. We want to create a better and more sustainable world for the future, yet no one is contributing to the positive change. Humans create more cows and animals just to slaughter them and infect the world with changes in climate. 
                   <br><br>


This film gave me a lot of new information about global warming that I hadn’t found through light research. It shocked me that domestic water use is only 5% of what is consumed in the US. 55% is from animal agriculture. People always say to take shorter showers and not to leave the sink on, and yet doing those things does not even put a dent in helping save the planet. I was also surprised to learn that 660 gallons of water are needed for just one burger. There is no way to sustainability raise enough animals to feed the world on current demands. Animal agriculture is the reason for climate change, yet everyone only talks about fossil fuels. This made me realize that meat is not the way to go and being vegetarian, vegan, or just cutting out meat can help our society. This gives me a pessimistic view of the future because no one is going to start cutting down on a product that they love and no one is educating the masses about this issue.

I agree that the film did a reasonable job of conveying the problem.  I had issues with some of the numbers Anderson mentions as they seem to be completely unbelievable.  When I checked, I was able to confirm that these numbers were ridiculously high.  The biggest example was the 55% of the emissions being approximately 15% in reality.  Though I agree this is still far too high, the inaccuracy hurts the credibility of the documentary.  

                   <br><br>

I also found it illuminating that most environmental advocacy groups are not willing to address or discuss the issue of animals.  I also found it interesting that people who speak their mind about the cruelty and inherent issues in these industries could be guilty of  under the Patriot Act.  The Patriot Act is meant to help prevent acts of terrorism before they occur and it is shocking to see how the U.S. government would consider this behavior an act of terrorism.  Though I understand unfounded claims could hurt the economy, which is a valid form or terrorism to prevent, it seems odd to penalize anyone fro speaking what is the truth, as was said by the 3rd generation farmer.

I found Cowspiracy very interesting on animal agriculture. So many different people had a reputation to take of that the supervisors hadn't admitted to anything of it. Kip would reach out to all these different programs and their websites yet he heard nothing. I found it interesting that every new person would avoid the answer or give something else. Spokespeople gave the burning of fossil fuels, gas and oil pipelines as the greatest way of emissions rising but animal agriculture produces 55% of the greenhouse gases. Whether it's livestock to fisheries, 3/4 of the fisheries are either exploited or overpopulated. I think education could solve a number of problems that'll arise. It's crazy how many environmentalists aren't supporting. Animal agriculture is something well known are the number 1 domestic.....

It is encouraging to see that there is something everyone can do that would make a contribution to reducing climate change.  There are some things, like reducing use of cars, that people are not willing to do because they are used to driving everywhere and they worked hard to get this car.  But, something like a change in diet, is easier to do because there is less inconvenience.  Eating less meat or not eating meat at all just requires that you buy different foods.  You do not have to go through extra effort in order to change your diet.  Whether or not you eat meat, you still have to go grocery shopping.
                   <br><br>
Kip Anderson states that animal production causes 51% of the carbon emissions in the atmosphere.  Although this number turned out to be wrong, it was effective in making me realise that food production is a big contributor to climate change.  To me, the fact that the number he is wrong does not matter much because after this quarter, it will not be important that I remember exactly what percentage of greenhouse gases food production contributes to the atmosphere, it is important that I know that food production is a big contributor.
                   <br><br>
I found it shocking that food production industries are so powerful that they can prevent environmentalist groups from sharing the fact that food production contributes a lot to climate change.  It is also very easy to see how effective those efforts are because there are probably a lot of people who do things like reduce their water use and switch to renewable energy sources but have never been made aware of how much food production affects the environment.

Before I continue, I wanted to note how irresponsible it was on Kip Anderson's behalf to present inaccurate statistics; I feel that it severely harms the message that they are trying to present. If one were to make a documentary about something so dire to our future, one really can't afford to give people reason to question one's credibility. There is no need to exaggerate the facts; they were bad enough as it is. 
                   <br><br>

Cowspiracy, while loose with the facts, does provide the audience with some insight into a major contributor to climate change. With the correction made by Hiltner, the agricultural sector as a whole still contributes 15% to global greenhouse emissions, 2% higher than that which is contributed by the transportation sector. Fortunately, this is something that we as individuals have the power to change on our own without relying on elected officials or technological revolutions. However, that being said, we must still exert tremendous pressure on our elected officials to continue moving society in the right direction. The film also takes note of the hypocrisy of whoever denounces domestic wasteful water practices, reminding us that the amount of water to produce one 1/4 pound hamburger requires about 660 gallons of water in production. 
                   <br><br>

However, one of the most shocking facts I heard from the film was that humans went from constituting 1% of global biomass to being responsible for 98% of the biomass (including livestock). This fact really sheds light on to the immense stress on our ecosystem to sustain and appease each of the pushing 8 billion individuals' desire to live. According to Kin Anderson, oceans are being pillaged at a rate that exceeds the rate at which they reproduce. 
                   <br><br>

Almost all factors of life are conspiring to push down the human population. Our pollution due to over and wasteful consumption harms many different ecosystems including one's in the ocean which we rely on for sustenance. Eventually, something will give out and many people are projected to suffer as a result.

The amount of controversy and strong opinions in the comments regarding Kip Anderson’s presentation of the animal agriculture industry’s effect on the environment was a bit overwhelming. I found myself questioning whether I should be moved by the film, angry, questioning it, or somewhere in the middle. Some of my classmates have a real way with words, and I saw many backing their arguments with their own research which I honestly respected. By answering Ken’s question, from my observations it seems the exaggeration of the statistics in the film did seem to do more harm than good because there are many people, not all, but many who despite trying to overlook this, are still left with ill feelings. If he had been truthful from the beginning, he possibly could have influenced a lot more people. Despite this, yours was the first comment out of many that I read that I could relate to after watching. While I was not happy about the incorrect statistics being featured, and agree that it was unnecessary considering that the statistics are truly bad enough; the film was very insightful about the realities of animal agriculture and moved me. The important point is clear, animal agriculture does have a great effect and being more conscious about the food we eat will make a difference that does not have to be felt years down the line, but now. Even prior to watching this film, when Ken said that the water used to produce 1 lb of beef could be used to produce 30 lbs of lentils was enough for me. But now after seeing the gallons and gallons of water used for livestock in ratios to the alternatives (assuming those statistics were accurate) was truly astonishing. I completely fell out when the film stated that it took 1000 gallons of water to produce 1 gallon of milk. The numbers are shocking. And to make matters worse, the suffering and conditions that these animals are forced to go through is the last straw for me. I was not sure if they would censor the duck’s head being cut off, but after watching that through my fingers I felt sick.
                   <br><br>

I have recently transitioned to a plant-based diet initially for health reasons, but now strongly for the environmental impact it has. I understand the frustration in the comments because when purposefully wrong information is presented it makes it hard for people to trust what they are reading and watching. Who knows how many other sources are misrepresenting their facts? It is very frustrating, for me as well, but I really hope that people are still realizing that what they eat has an impact, and making changes will help our world.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with the idea that the inaccuracies in the statistics harms the message presented in 'Cowspiracy'. Because of this, I find it hard to recommend to family and friends. 'Wasted' is a good alternative, but one thing 'Cowspiracy' focuses on that is unique is the conspiracy aspect where environmental organizations seem to ignore the issue of emissions from the meat/dairy industries. This is important to note as it raises questions about why certain industries are protected and encourages people to follow the money when it comes to environmental policy and awareness. Since 'Cowspiracy' is outdated it'd be nice to have a more current version that focuses on the meat/dairy industries and compares it to the every-growing meat substitute industries in terms of environmental impact.

The film “Cowspiracy” really shocked me, initially I was taken aback by the startling statistics. It is mind numbing to me that cows consume so much water. Although I enjoy things like hamburgers and steaks, like most other Americans, I don’t think they should come at such a high environmental cost. Watching “Cowspiracy” I felt almost selfish knowing that there are people in the world, even in the United States, who barely have access to clean safe drinking water. Yet, here I am, continuing to consume water-intensive agriculture on a semi-regular basis. I knew that meat-consumption was especially bad for the environment, but this film really helped put things into perspective for me as to just how bad the situation really is.
                   <br><br>
Something else that enraged me during this documentary was how nearly every organization interviewed was unwilling or reluctant to talk about or acknowledge the impact of the agricultural industry on the environment. How can they claim to be protectors of the environment when they can’t even identify one of its biggest threats? If we really want environmental change, we cannot be afraid of big business and their power. If we don’t stand against corporations and their damaging practices, no one will.

I also felt shocked by the argument that animal agriculture was consuming more natural resources such as clean water than those consumed by human beings. As suggested in Ken’s video, animal production contributes to 15% of greenhouse gas emission which is far beyond my expectation. Meanwhile I have to admit that it’s kind of difficult for me to switch to a plant-based diet even though it’s healthier and more environmental-friendly. Another point I share the same feeling with you is how annoying that no so-called earth-protector organizations have been addressing this issue currently. I felt more irritated learning the fact that some environmentalists such as Sister Dorothy Stang, got killed for speaking up against cattle industry. This profitability VS sustainability battle is everlasting which will definitely contribute to more climate changes. Even though there is lack of credibility in Anderson’s documentary, I was still disappointed by how corporations were overlooking the issue on animal agriculture. It’s super clear that they value their long-term profitability more than the environment. With the increasing population in this day and age, it’s unavoidable that more meat will be consumed and more greenhouse gas will be produced by the meat industry. Probably we should try to switch our diet and waste less food, in terms of make small changes to save our planet.


<br><hr>
I have the same feeling with you. This is so bad for me to realize that how many resources have been used just for a single burger. Water is one of the most important element on the earth that makes people alive. Every steak, beef, and any other meat we consume have really bad impact on the environment. As you have mentioned, the meat-consuming company prefers to decline the fact that their production has greatly done harm to the environment. As a result, even if some of us stop consuming meat, what the company will do is keeping producing more delicious meat-made food to attract more customers to buy their product. The situation cannot be simply changed by regulating our diet. Therefore, we’re supposed to help other people who have not realized how the every meat they eat will harm the environment to know the fact, and help them changing eating habits. In this way, as meat consumers become less and less, the industry will no longer produce such a large amount of meat, and do less harm to the environment.
<br><hr>
Yeah, I couldn’t agree with you more. The documentary, Cowspiracy, questions why all environmental organizations are currently neglecting one of the most influential sources of environmental damage, which is animal agriculture and explores several policies addressing this issue. One statistic was shocking to me that American households occupy only 5% of the water in the states, whereas the livestock industry uses up to 55% of the total. The production of animal agriculture requires a large amount of water like milk and beef. This will actually become an endless loop where animal agriculture uses up a lot of water and the continuing water shortage makes the whole industry unsustainable. These negative impacts don’t come singly but in pairs: the documentary states that livestock agriculture contributes 18% of the total greenhouse gas emitted, which is actually 5% more than the emission of all forms of transportations. I’ve never thought of a fact like this based on my knowledge and this just stunned me. The infamous transportation emission has been overshadowing and blocking the negative effect of animal agriculture since day one.
                   <br><br>


Moreover, the increasing demand for farmlands is exponentially speeding up deforestation, in which 80% of the Amazon rainforest is destroyed by it. Another statistic brings me back to the reality: with 160-million acres degraded due to the animal industry, 40% of the total rainforest area will be gone in 20 years, influencing the lives of hundreds and thousands of natural species. Animal agriculture is also responsible for the existence of ocean dead zones. This is just a sad and scary picture as a whole and we should mitigate it ASAP.

I think "Cowspiracy" was effective at getting its point across but It seems it was filled with a bias towards finding some sort of "conspiracy"  in regards to animal agriculture. Because of this it may have painted many organizations in a somewhat negative light on purpose when there might not have been a reason too. For example I feel like a lot of the interviews that Kip Anderson conducted with officials from the various environmental organizations were cut and edited to help Anderson support his view that he had discovered the harms of agricultural industry to the environment when in reality these groups could’ve had insightful information that was not shown in the movie because it moved against the central point of the film. I also was not very convinced by Anderson's sources. For multiple interviews he would only cite his "51% of emissions come from the agricultural industry" statistic that he found from one source. From my own research I have deduced that this is in fact incorrect. I think he would have had a more convincing argument and gained more support for his film and ideas if he had a variety of sources from which he could cite. It was due to his falsehoods in information that I was forced to take a very analytical and logical approach in regards to a movie that tries extremely hard to push its message across by gripping the viewers emotions. As a result, I found myself questioning Anderson's interviewing tactics, such as how he becomes more confrontational to those he believes are apart of the conspiracy and reversely has more open questions and a calmer attitude towards those who support his viewpoint. Even so, the film does raise into question the dangers that animal agriculture has on our environment. The main takeaway from the film was this idea that a lot more resources are being consumed when someone eats beef that many of us just don’t think about. When you eat beef you are in fact eating all the resources that it took to produce that cow. This idea of an underlying cost is prevalent in most environmental discussions in regards to the Climate Crisis I have noticed. The film, although it prevented skewed information, did get its message across that consumers should look at the underlying costs that their purchases have.

I just wanted to say that I completely agree with your claim that the film “cowspiracy” got the point across about the agricultural industry, but forces on the audience that there’s some sort of conspiracy. As you said, I feel like Kip Anderson shined some negative light on some of the environmental organizations that he got interviews with and the ones he didn’t get an interview with. I didn’t realize it until I saw your comment, but when you said that you felt like “a lot of the interviews that Kip Anderson conducted with officials from the various environmental organizations were cut and edited…”, it made sense to me. It was probably edited in such a way to make it look like his “cowspiracy” theory was true. When he brought up that “51% of emissions come from the agricultural industry”, I couldn’t believe it. How could I have been so oblivious to this problem? It wasn’t until I watched Ken’s video discussing the film, that this was not the case. Instead of 51%, it was actually 15%. That’s a big difference. How can one make such an error? Kip’s whole film was based on that statistic. I definitely agree with you that he would’ve had a more convincing argument and more support on the film if he had a variety of sources. After reading your comment I’m starting to realize, now that I think of it, that Kip’s interviewing tactics were a bit questioning. As you said, “he becomes more confrontational to those he believes are apart of the conspiracy and reversely has more open questions and a calmer attitude towards those who support his viewpoint.” Either way, the film does, in fact, get the point across that the agricultural industry is causing harm to our planet. Even if the 51% statistic isn’t true, 15% is still a significant amount for the food we consume and also waste.

From the film I was pitiful to learn that there are numerous activists that are murdered for their work against the animal farming industry. One line that stood out to me from the film was that “you can’t call yourself an earthy person and eat meat, period. As somebody that still has not cut meat out of their diet, but needs to require portion in moving forward the environment, I feel like this line was coordinated specifically at me. 
                   <br><br>
This line clearly tells me what I ought to begin doing right presently to begin with and preeminent on the off chance that I need to be an environmentalist. I've been contemplating becoming a vegetarian myself. What I’ve come to realize from observing, “Cowspiracy”, is that creature agribusiness contributes to more than fair methane omissions. It contributes to expanded carbon dioxide emanations, water consumption, produces nitrogen oxides, and leads to deforestation, and overgrazing. This makes me indeed more disturbed at the truth that many of the organizations Kip talked to within the film were neglectful or declined to reply. Overall I delighted in observing this film and I thought I learned a lot.

I think the film effective at communicating its subject, which is Cows piracy. This film starts with the director his self-experience that he watch Al Gore’s film and began to do something helpful to our environment, like became an OCE, separated the trash and recycling, changed the light bulbs, took short showers. But when he saw a report from the United Nation. He had to wonder, with all the continuing ecological crisis facing the planet even if every single one of us adopted these conservation habits, was this gonna be enough to save the world? In the report, cows produce more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector. He interviews a lot of specialists that work on environmental things. From these specialists, the leading cause of global warming is transportation and other things, exclude the animal agricultural industry. The film uses data and interviews to support the director’s opinion. 
                   <br><br>

I feel that the earth already in a very dangerous situation. The rainforest destruction, species extinction, habitat loss, topsoil erosion, ocean “dead zones,” famine, this list doesn’t stop, but this environmental disaster that’s being ignored by the very people who should be championing. About the problem that not only did livestock play a major role in global warming, it is also the leading cause of resource consumption and environmental degradation destroying the planet today. The largest environmental groups didn’t mention it anywhere. Those environmentalists always call for various actions to protect the planet, but they remain silent in the face of the most serious problems. People damage the ecological environment intoaise livestock. They even kill those people who spoke out the truth. Sister Dorothy Stang, who lives in the heart of the Brazilian rainforest, her life’s work was to protect the Amazon. She spoke out openly against the destruction of the rainforest from cattle ranching for years. And one night, she was killed by a hired gun from the cattle industry. Over 1100 activists have been killed in the last 20 years in Brazil. Also, changing eating habits could be very difficult to achieve. I used to agree that the transportation we use play a major role in global warming. But after watching this film, I know that the greenhouse gases emissions are13% for all transportation, and 15% for animal agriculture. People raise the animal to grow up and kill them or sell them to get money. It seems cruel and make me feel uncomfortable. I think I would eat less meat. I fell pessimistic because the animal agricultural industry seems like a global issue. And ask people don’t eat meat will cause social instability. It is hard to solve the animal industry problem. We can’t just ask them to stop.

Cowspiracy was a film that completely shocked me in terms of the responses that many environmental groups had in regards to the leading cause of carbon emissions. Watching each person grow in agitation and nervousness as the narrator asked the question, made me really wonder what is going on in the industry, especially when he asked the question if the meat industries give donations to environmental groups. It's absolutely insane that these groups that are trying to help the environment, are possibly partnering with the people who contribute the most to the carbon in the atmosphere.  Why aren't we doing anything??? 
                   <br><br>


I myself have not eaten red meat for the past 7 years, and my boyfriend just now recently started to cut down on his red meat consumption because of the impact on the climate. I originally stopped eating beef due to how these cows are treated as well as the health benefits of no eating red meat. It surprised me to hear that there is just no way that we can change to all grass-fed beef due to land availability. I do believe that once we limit our beef consumption dramatically,  then once there is a smaller supply chain, moving to healthier forms of production seems more feasible. Overall it really amazed me how much agriculture affects our planet and how no one knows, everyone is focused on the big businesses that burn our fossil fuels and they see eating a plant-based diet as something that won't really help the environment that much. 

                   <br><br>

I had to stop watching the film because as soon as the started to show the dairy factory and especially the long clip of the ducks head being chopped off, I simply could not watch anymore. I did enjoy the film in being able to question those people who have spent their life trying to help the environment but leave out one of the biggest things that harm our atmosphere.

I find myself agreeing with you on many aspects you mentioned. As the film went on, I got more and more frustrated by all the organizations that were interviewed. Those people are supposed to protect and advocate for the environment, yet they are so ignorant that they completely disregard one of the biggest contributors to climate change. It makes me really angry to find out that most big environmental organizations like Greenpeace probably receive funding from the animal industry and thus refuse to raise awareness for the part they play in our climate crisis. I really didn't think that those companies were that corrupt as well and now I wonder if we can even trust any organization that claims to fight for our world or the people in it. It reminded me of reading once that most charity organizations like the Red Cross keep a portion of the donations they receive for themselves instead of giving it to the people in need they claim to care so much about. I really don't know who to trust anymore. I guess the only way to find out the truth is to do your own research like Kip Andersen did in "Cowspiracy".
                   <br><br>


Just like you, one of the parts that shocked me the most was seeing that duck getting slaughtered. I had previously watched this documentary a few years ago but had to stop when I saw that scene with the duck. This time, however, I kept watching and I'm glad I did, but that doesn't mean that witnessing that slaughter didn't make me want to throw up. I couldn't even imagine seeing that with my own eyes in real life - watching it on the small screen of my laptop was already enough to almost bring me to tears. At first, I was really shocked that they even showed that scene because of how gruesome it is. But now that I think of it, maybe it was smart to include it in the documentary. I think that we as consumers are so disconnected from the reality of where our food comes from and how it is made that we all need a wake-up call like that. If you ask most people that eat meat, they obviously now that the animal has to be killed in order to be eaten and I believe most people are also aware of the fact that they are not peacefully put to sleep but instead slaughtered. However, if you'd ask those people if they were willing to watch an animal - whether it be a cow, a duck, or a chicken - get slaughtered right in front of their eyes, I think most would say no, they don't wanna see that. Well, surprise! This is what happens every time you choose to eat an animal and if you don't want to acknowledge the reality of the situation, then maybe you shouldn't eat meat in the first place.

After watching the film "Cowspiracy", I have really reflected on my own eating habits and thought about what I can do to make myself better. Thinking about the fact that 1/3 to 1/2 of food is being wasted, I realize that I do end up wasting a good amount of food, mostly when I go out to eat, because of portion sizes that restaurants offer. A lot of places give much more food than is necessary and walking into any restaurant, you will see plates eft behind with tons of food every time. I think that dining out is a big platform for food consumption and if we can communicate to restaurants to limit portion sizes to what is really necessary and to assess the amount of food being wasted at their locations, it will help a great deal. Making food at home is easier to control as you can gauge how much you eat yourself instead of someone else doing it for you. 
                   <br><br>

In regards to the red meat issue, I think that society has put a pretty big divide up between vegetarians and meat eaters and it has created a stigma that prevents people from changing sides. I also think that in the past a big push for vegetarianism was due to animal cruelty and I think that people still highly associate it with still only that and not climate change issues. People aren't realizing the effects that it has on the whole planet rather than just the animals that some people don't care about harming. For myself, I struggle with this a bit because A I do not want to harm animals and B I do not want to harm the earth but the fact that meat has been such a great part of my diet forever, it is hard for me to fathom completely getting rid of it. It has become easier however with the new creations of fake meat products and a bigger market for vegetarian options and I hope that with the continuance of that and the spread of information about meat consumption and animal agriculture being the top contributor to climate change that people, including myself, will be more inclined and take harsher action to alter lifestyles.

I also thought about my eating habits and how much food I waste. I agree with you that restaurant portion sizes are way too big. I am rarely ever able to finish anything unless I share it or eat of the kids' menu. I also agree that we should communicate with restaurants to have smaller portion sizes to waste less food. I think that part of the problem with restaurants is you can order appetizers which will fill you up before the other food even gets there causing food to be wasted.
                   <br><br>
Looking at my own diet I really want to try to cut back on meat and I have already started doing so. The dining hall makes it easy because they always have options that don't contain meat. I believe that if we start educating people of all of the resources that we use on the meat industry they would be more inclined to start cutting back. When the quarter first started I told my family that they should start cutting back on meat and explained why. When I came home to visit them they told me that they had started having meatless Mondays and Fridays.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with everything you mentioned. I also see tons of food left behind on plates when I go out to eat and it’s upsetting knowing all of that has now just gone to waste. I think you pointed out a great solution that we should communicate and get the portion sizes in restaurants to be smaller. If we don't act now, we are going to continue to see this happening in hundreds of places. Not only would smaller portions be better for us but it would help limit the amount of food leftover. The film had me reflect on my own eating habits as well and although it could be hard at times to have a more plant-based diet, I have actually been cooking with less meat and buying substitutions. I agree with what you said when you mentioned you do not want to hurt animals or the planet. Some people fail to acknowledge that changing eating habits is effective for our environment as well. It's been easier for me to transition since I am able to find recipes online. Although I have not gone completely vegan, I have enjoyed incorporating vegan meals into my diet.

<br><hr>
I agree with what you mentioned about eating out, in that food portions are really a one size fits all option, rather than unique to each person. I feel that the same could be said about our buffet style dining practices found throughout our on campus dining commons. While more time efficient, the portions we are served are really a one size fits all practice, which leads to increased amounts of food waste. This ranging from the plate and bowl portions to goods such as peanut butter and jelly. If you were to attend a dining common the amount of food wasted, based upon the preserved portions is seemingly pretty high in my experience. Ken raise the idea of a 'freegan,' which if implemented with buffet style serving, as we have on campus, could dramatically reduce the food waste we produce. Which to my knowledge, a lot of dining hall food is thrown out due to how it ages, which at the very least, partnering with say a shelter may greatly impact the amounts in which are wasted.
                   <br><br>
In regard to the film, I feel that it's important that people are more aware of where the food they eat comes from, as well as the food (in this case beef) industry's control. Once again, our school dining common's consumption of meat holds at a staggering rate. From the daily lunch hamburgers, to late night offerings, the ability to consume red meat leads to the consumption of more of it overall. Since joining this class, I've tried to take part in reducing my animal based food footprint, and specifically my red meat intake. But for many, with such easy access, the ability to eat red meat everyday is there.




<br><hr>
I can relate to this comment in the aspect of the meat eating. On the daily, I think about the food I am eating and how I shouldn’t be eating meat. It’s so hard for me because meat eating is so prevalent in my culture and I grew up eating it everyday. Although I know the impacts and I really hate the idea of hurting animals, I still find it hard to choose other options over meat. I have lowered my consumption of meat, but I just cannot cut it out of my life completely, even though I know it is bad. I think it’s great that people are thinking of alternatives and making it easier to not eat meat, because, for people like me, it is so difficult.
                   <br><br>


One thing I am glad about is that I am extremely against food waste and I always do my best to not waste any food that I buy. I didn’t realize that it actually made such a positive impact on the environment, but now I am glad that I am doing something to help. Even though becoming vegan for environmental effects is not advocated on a huge scale, I feel as if it is still more common to know about how plant based diets affect the climate rather than know the effects of food waste. I think that having less food waste should be advocated on a larger scale, because I see people everywhere, even my own housemates, waste so much food every day. I wish that more people would understand that food waste is terrible and buy less groceries so they don’t let them rot and throw them away, and cook more home made meals.

Be honest, I was angry and sad when I watched the documentary. All those negative emotions were filled into my mind. Using one sentence that Kip said commonly after he interviewed or got emails from different organizations: it is bizarre. I was so frustrated that even people knew the truth, but they can’t yell it aloud because of the powerful cattle company, and those companies can even “control” the decision of the Congress. Because of the funding, because of the money, everyone is running away from the truth. Why!!! The planet almost died because of our movement, because of the livestocks, and we will also become extinct because of this. What is more important than life? I can’t believe those authoritative organizations will hide from this question. Every US citizen is getting information from your websites, they deeply believe the solutions the website gives, but how could you not even mention the real reason of climate change. Those organizations are throwing American’s efforts away, and even making fun of them. I am so disappointed after watching the film.

While watching the film Cowspiracy, I was surprised at how so many large organizations that were trying to save the planet just neglected and hid the fact that animal agriculture was such a big problem. I became frustrated when Kip Andersen went to so many different organizations that were focused on stopping the climate crisis and he either got ignored or not given the truth. For instance, when he went to Greenpeace, they kept telling him that after consideration that they would not be able to help him. They probably didn’t set up an interview or meeting with him because they knew he was going to talk about animal agriculture and they didn’t want to put the organization and themselves into jeopardy. I really disliked how activists in the past were either sued or even killed because they were spreading the truth. This is the reason so many large organizations don’t want to promote the truth that animal agriculture is one of the worst factors for the environment. These animal agriculture and food production corporations, in my opinion, have too much power and nobody should need to have that type of fear when all they’re trying to do is spread the truth. I hope more people can see this informative and enlightening film and make changes to their daily lifestyles.

I thought a lot of these same things while I was watching Cowspiracy, as well. When so many organizations simply ignore this giant problem, it's very frustrating, as there's no way to collectively make steps towards fixing climate crisis if we're just going to ignore one of the biggest contributions to the problem. A lot of these themes in the film reminded me of the oil and fossil fuel industries that create major problems that are often just over looked or ignored by the populous and some major organizations. It's so difficult combating the climate crisis when the obvious causes are simply being ignored for underlying financial reasons. It seems nearly impossible to take down these powerful, money hungry markets like that of the beef or oil industry. Therefore, the only way we, as citizens, can make our voice heard is through our own money. While these organizations can easily ignore our voices and calls to actions, they're not going to be able to ignore a loss in revenue. If money is the only thing these powerful companies care about, we need to use that to our advantage and make them see the wrong in their actions by financially withdrawing support.

Cowspiracy was a documentary that had me very intrigued. It was curious to see that although animal agriculture is a big emitter of gases into the atmosphere many people very much wanted to avoid talking about it. I questioned why and the documentary answered. People may have either been afraid to speak out about the truths or didn’t want to put their companies in jeopardy by admitting this fact. It was disappointing watching Ken’s video “Cowspiracy and Wasted” because of the fact that some of the statements in the documentary were false. Although it is a big issue, it isn’t as bad as I had initially thought. I think that maybe Kip Anderson was trying to take a more alarmist approach when trying to inform us about agriculture pollution which is okay when trying to get people to do something about the issue. 
                   <br><br>

 It was bizarre to learn that some people think oceans and seafood are a sustainable option for feeding the entire world’s population. I learned that most fisheries are over exploited and that 75% of fish are now depleted. One man getting interviewed had no clue about this and even compared fish as “living off interest” when in reality we are actually depleting the principle at a very aggressive rate. Another alarming fact was that around 100 living organisms go extinct per day because the rainforest is being destroyed at a rate of 1 football field per second. That is just ridiculous. Overall, I feel like it was a good documentary that was very informative about the issue of pollution caused by agriculture but I am curious to see how much of the facts in the documentary were true.

I agree with you about Anderson talking an alarmist approach in the documentary Cowspiracy. However, I don’t think that it’s actually okay when trying to inform people about an issue. It took away some of his credibility and created ammunition for people like deniers to counter his arguments. There are other ways to make people aware and use the truth at the same time. A lot of facts about climate and agriculture are alarming without stretching them. Although both Cowspiracy and Wasted are very eye opening and well made, it also makes me wonder if the facts in the film Wasted have been checked.

I knew already that our society wastes a significant amount of our food, but seeing the statistics on just how much while watching "Wasted" was honestly shocking. Every day I see wasted food piled up on the used dishes in the dining commons as they’re sent back to be washed, but I never really thought much of it. Hearing that over ⅓ of all food produced is never eaten, and that over 90% of the wasted food in the US ends up in landfills, was absolutely appalling. Food waste in landfills releases methane into the atmosphere, and a single head of lettuce, buried in trash, can take up to 25 years to decompose. Clearly we need to do something to resolve this problem, and that has to start with a cultural, and personal, change in the way we think about food waste.

                   <br><br>

When I was in elementary school, we went on many field trips that I thought at the time were strange destinations to bring children, like a landfill, and a sewage water treatment plant. Looking back, however, I see the importance of bringing these places, along with the issues surrounding them, into people’s awareness at a young age. In elementary, my school built a garden, and our classes would take turns watering the plants, picking fruits, and mixing the compost with Dave the Worm Man (who my third grade self thought was the absolute HEIGHT of cool). My dad also had a garden in our backyard with a compost bin, so I grew up being told that fruit peels and the like just did not go in the trash, as with paper or plastic bottles.

                   <br><br>

I think it’s so important that we have compost bins around campus right next to the trash and recycling. This should be common practice! While back home over Christmas break, I was shocked to realize that I couldn’t find even a single recycling bin in the downtown park, let alone compost. Another great thing that I found out about when I got to UCSB were the Big Belly Solar trash cans around campus, which use solar energy to compact the trash onsite, meaning they need to be emptied less frequently and therefore generate less waste. These are the kinds of innovations that we need to make widespread in order to combat this problem!

When you have the combination of being considered an "alarmist" and someone who knowingly uses false statistics, you create an atmosphere of distrust and opposition. Kip Andersen had great intentions with the film, but if you're trying to create a paradigm shift in a culture that has been indoctrinated by animal-based products then you are going to need to take a different route to solve the problem. I can't say for sure what happened when the truth came out behind some of the statistics, but I'm sure there was a shift back to eating animal-based products.
                   <br><br>

In terms of designing the future of our world, I still do believe that altering our diet towards being plant-based will have the biggest impact as a sole individual looking to contribute to the environmental movement.  I don't think that animal-based diets will ever be entirely phased out of the world, but I do think it is our only option for 90% of the world's population to phase it out. An interesting concept arises though if we entirely phase out animal-based products, we will be contributing to the extinction of certain domesticated animals. It is sad to think of, but if we do not have a use for these animals then there will be no purpose in having them around. I'm not saying it is entirely bad, but it seems to be a necessary consequence if we are going to shift towards a plant-based society.

I completely agree with you first statement Ryan. The issue of climate change and specifically the negative effects that the meat / food production industry bring onto this issue seem to carry an overwhelming negative stigma. While I agree that Anderson's intentions in bringing to light the impact of our consumption habits via this film, his alarmist and sarcastic tone along with his use of inaccurate statistics frame this topic as somewhat of a "joke" or the overall issue as lacking credibility. As frustrating as it may sound, films like Cowspiracy are a misstep in the progress of climate crisis awareness as it allows for the "doubters" and those working against climate change activism an example of how "wrong" or "misinformed" the community is.
                   <br><br>


I have to admit that I had actually been putting off this film as I had heard by many of my other friends (also UC students) that the film lacked new information however the overall topic of "overfishing" was completely new to me. I was honestly alarmed when learning about how it is many species are taken out of the ocean as a result of fishing for the food industry. The film continues to hold valuable information in that it pushes the narrative of just how important altering our diet holds a correlation to the well-doing of our planet. I also agree with Ryan's opinion in that I don' necessarily think a non-meat, non-dairy, or completely no animal product diet will ever be as popular as we'd like it to be but taking steps away from consuming the amount and type of animals we do, as we know now can only have positive impacts on our current environment.

Lastly, addressing Ken's comment about "freegans', I can't say I'm completely against the concept. Food waste is a huge problem in America, an especially upsetting problem when we take into consideration the amount of untouched, unexpired, packaged, fresh but somehow "unusable" food that is discarded. I worked at Target as a teenager and remember how annoyed I would be when people decided to not purchase a produce or refrigerated item. Targets policy (in 2016, not sure now) encouraged their cashiers to toss food items directly into the trash if customers decided they no longer needed them as the fact that they were handled and technically not in their proper (refrigerated or unpackaged) state meant these items were unable to be donated or sold. This issue is presented in just about every place we shop and eat at and an overwhelming issue we keep looking past which is why I understand the "extreme" approach "freegans" take.

I agree with your statement in the second paragraph referring to the idea that as a society, it may be completely impossible to change to a 100 percent plant-based society, but we can get close. There are many counties around the world who live off of a majority plant-based diet and have been doing so for thousands of years. There is no reason why we cannot adopt some of those values and follow suit. We need to be open minded to the possibilities and advantages of eating less meat. Our society has gotten much more accepting of diets like vegan and vegetarian, but I believe there is still a negative stigma surrounding them in some cases. I think the reason behind this is lack of education and the lack of willingness to deviate from the style of living we are used to. 
                    <br><br>

One of the main reasons I believe It will be impossible to completely transfer into a plant-based society is because of the large market surrounding beef and animal products. Large corporations make millions of dollars off of our desire and need for meat and they are going to continue to raise livestock as long as they are making profit. That combined with American’s desire for meat makes the livestock industry a booming market. Agricultural corporations are not going to stop raising and selling livestock just because our environment is at risk. They have been too successful over the last few decades to care about anything other than profit.

Yet again, I cried watching a video required for this class. I do not eat meat, and haven’t for 13 years-- at the age I realized beef was a cow, pork was a pig, and chicken was a chicken… For me, at the age of 7, I couldn’t bear the thought of eating a murdered animal. I would literally hear screams and imagine pools of blood any time I looked at meat. However, I noticed when I watched this video it made me incredibly sad and want to become completely vegan again, but for my friends in the class, who do consume meat, they didn’t think twice about switching their diets. I think videos like cowspiracy only really impact the people who already care enough to change. 
                    <br><br>
I wish I was surprised when so many “environmentalists” denied the effects of livestock on our planet. Kip getting his facts wrong will definitely only fuel the fire for rejectors of the harmful effects of animal consumption. Overall, I thought this documentary was very informative and I desperately hope it moves people enough to change their eating habits.

I agree with your stance on your opinion about meat consumption. Personally, I have never been a big meat eater at all throughout my life, but I feel as though it is time to completely cut it out of my diet. Especially after watching "Wasted!". The film was definitely my initiative to realize how important these small changes are whether or not we believe it makes any impact. As far as these so called "environmentalists" you mentioned, I am with you on how horrible the whole thing is. There are so many people that are quick to agree with the inaccurate idea of meat consumption not affecting this climate crisis at all. They would be even quicker to believe that absurdity if they have anyone with "validity" to back up their opinion on the matter.

<br><hr>
I’m glad you agree. I didn’t watch “Wasted!” but if it was anything like “Cowspiracy” I can see why you want to cut meat completely out of your diet. I hope other students in this class feel the same way, and hopefully influence their peers to switch to a plant based diet. The “environmentalists” mentioned definitely don’t have their facts straight and are clearly just saying whatever they can to continue to promote the multi-million (possibly billion) meat industry. It’s sad to see that mass profit takes priority over the well being of individuals and the planet as a whole.

Out of all of the material that has been presented in this course, Cowspiracy was the piece that most substantially blew my mind. First of all, there has been no other source of carbon emissions that has been as great as the agriculture sector, with an astounding 51% of global emissions. Even beyond this fact, I was more perplexed by the fact that the largest environmental agencies were not producing this information, making me completely question my own moral process of selecting which organizations to support. While it is true that the organizations were still doing good for the climate crisis in all other types of emissions, they were choosing to omit the largest contributor to CO2 release. Some might claim that they were unaware of this fact due to the overarching power of animal agriculture; however, it was clearly seen with the making of this documentary that a lot of the large environmental organizations were either unwilling to meet with Kip Anderson, wouldn’t provide any information, were not receptive to his presented claims, or would later decide to retract their support for his work. It seems as though the organizations were engaging severe close mindedness towards a monumental problem that requires rational skepticism and constant reanalysis. Within the film, there was a comparison that stuck with me. It connected the effect of animal agriculture on the climate crisis to an alcoholic father, describing a family that was devastated with conflict, but no one would address the fact that this was attributed to the father’s alcoholism. I found this to be a perfect way to describe the central conflict of this piece. In the same way that the family can only solve their conflict by addressing the father’s alcohol problem, the climate crisis will not be solved without recognizing that agriculture is devastating the state of the Earth in a way that no other category of emissions remotely comes close to.

Just like you, I was incredibly shocked at how these environmental agencies were avoiding one of, if not the biggest environmental issue. All of the organizations that were interviewed seemed like they were hiding something. It's even crazier how the organization Green Peace refused to have an interview, twice. One of the biggest environmental organizations seemed to be scared of an interview about an environmental issue. You would expect an organization like this to take this up as an opportunity to address an issue, but in reality, all they wanted to do was avoiding this issue.
                    <br><br>

 In addition, each interview felt like it was awkward. Each conservation felt like any information about animal agriculture had to be forced out of the interviewees. When a response was finally evoked, it was often the interviewee acting like they had no idea about the statistic. If this is true and they genuinely didn't know the adverse effects of animal agriculture, then I have no idea why they are able to be a lead director for any of these organizations. 
                    <br><br>

Lastly, I would like to address the fact that 51% of global emissions was caused by animal agriculture. There has been a lot of controversy with this fact and many people believe that it is only around 15%. Either way, this is still significant and something needs to change.

Although some people will probably disagree with me, I do appreciate the fact that the documentary shifted perspectives halfway through in order to see the moral consequences of a meat- eating diet. So many of us are disconnected from the food that is on our plate. we don't realize all of the terrible things that animals are subjected to in order to get that Big Mac on the plate. The talk about morality gives us a new, complimentary perception of the livestock industry. Hopefully, this gives people more incentive to switch to a more plant-based diet. Every time I see animals being slaughtered in horrid living conditions, I become more and more repulsed by the idea of meat consumption and the entire livestock industry in general. 
                    <br><br>
I do, however, think many of these activists have a slightly closed perspective on the issue. It's quite obvious that the solution to the problem isn't as simple as just switching to a vegan diet. There are so many people that, until death, will continuously eat meat, and I genuinely don't believe there is anything we can do about it without government intervention. This is why I think the "meat 6 days a week" is a perfectly fine process in order to slowly segue into a more sustainable, ethical lifestyle. The process doesn't have to be an immediate on/off, but more a gradual alteration of societal culture.

It is very frustrating to see and to know how those organizations that claimed to be green and environmentally friendly or seeking ways to help with climate change problem are denying the fact that animal agriculture/cattle raising would bring such a huge greenhouse gas emission to our environment. What makes me kind of upset is to hear how people working in the organizing that they are supposed to know the facts about the issue would either say they don’t know anything or not sure about the facts for the causes.

                    <br><br>

I know meat, especially beef consumption/ dairy products consumption are a part of many people’s lives, but I do think it is time that we should all start considering the problem not just ignoring it. Even if we don’t all have to be complete vegetarians, reducing beef/dairy products consumption is actually not hard. I haven’t been drinking milk for so long but instead I drink soy milk; I also start reducing my consumption on beef on a large amount. I am not a vegetarian, but it is not hard to make small changes on my diet just to be a bit more environmentally friendly. And I think many people can do the same thing it just depends on whether you are willing to facing the issue or not and whether you want to help address the issue or not.

You would expect that these organizations that claim to be fighting for climate change would be telling you the truth but are not even telling the whole story. They are telling what benefits them and it is crazy because in every interview Anderson asks “what is the main cause of climate change” and none of them said it is due to animal agriculture until he mentions it. How are these organizations not going to know that animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of climate change, and why are they hiding it? I start to have doubt in these organizations, if they are not being completely honest about something they are advocating for, I can only imagine what other sketchy stuff can be going on. We must start off by reducing our meat consumption and then eliminating it for good. Meat consumption is very harmful to the environment.

My initial reaction after watching the film was of extreme surprise. I did not even realize how ignorant I was about the extreme consequences that eating meat and livestock causes for the planet. The fact that just 1.5 BILLION cows (out of a total 70 BILLION livestock animals) drink 45 billion gallons of water and consume 135 billion pounds of food every day is absolutely mind-blowing. I didn't even fathom such high numbers and such an extreme amount of resources that goes into producing only a few pounds of the meat that I eat everyday. 
                    <br><br>
I thought it was also very shocking that humans can exceed the CO2 individual emissions quota by 2030 just by eating livestock, without counting any other form of CO2 emissions. I think this was probably the most impactful part of the documentary, that even if we cut down all else, it will still not be good enough if we consume meat. But, at the same time, I feel like the solution for people who demand meat in their diet is not to stop consuming meat completely. I think it is to revert to primitive ways of eating meat, treating it as a luxury and only eating a few portions and not massively consuming it. 
                    <br><br>
It was not until I watched Ken's lecture and read some of the comments below that I found out about the wrong statistics of the documentary. Nevertheless, I feel that this documentary was informative and educational about the waste and climate effects that our massive meat-reliant diet causes.

I did not enjoy the "Cowspiracy" documentary. The difference between 50% and 15% is very large, and to inflate the facts, whether on purpose or not, does not make sense to me to keep in the film. If the purpose is to educate the audience and convince them to switch to a vegan diet then at the very least give correct facts, because for me it killed the documentary's credibility. I am not a climate crisis denier, and I try to eat a plant based diet like how the film advocates, but I would not show this film to others in order to convince them to stop eating meat. Aside from the credibility issue, the holier than thou attitude that the narrator adopted throughout most of the film made it hard to watch. Sure I can agree with part of the message but wow did I hate watching it.

I personally enjoy the documentary, Wasted, the story of waste, It brought me with a wider aspect of wasting food and also kind of bringing me back to the concept of Minimalism, living small. I was born in a family where my father has his restaurant in China. Yes, I was living with my family, but I hate how his thoughts on food waste. As what’s been mentioned in the video, I personally know who those restaurants and chefs’ wastes on food. They only take what they need, or which part has a better flavor , and throw the rest of them into trash bins. They are business people. They are chefs. They seem to have the magic power to create delicious dishes. But in my eyes, no they never do that. Honestly, they are making crimes on the wastes of food. They even show no respects on food and animals, As growing within this type of family background, I will never behavior like them, I cook for myself and I am kind of a “Vegan” eater, only eat fish and chicken, no red meat. My parents think I am a psycho and always ask me if you don’t eat meat, where will you get your proteins from? Hilarious.

I was astounded by the number of prevalent organizations which refused to talk about this issue. Seeing so many groups being so unnerved and so ingenuine was surprising and difficult to watch. We hope that these organizations are honest, yet seemingly they ignore truths which do not perfectly fit within their framework. I found it interesting when an interviewee mentioned that it was probably not mentioned because it did not poll well in focus groups. Just because something does not poll well, does not mean that it is wrong or not worth stating. I hope that with more films like these, the public can be more exposed to diets which are less meat heavy and more plant focused.

I think that “Cowspiracy” was effective at communicating its subject by including many statistics and interviews from highly educated professionals, as well as using reports from credible sources. It also included some graphic clips that affected the audience's emotions and opened their eyes to the harsh side of animal agriculture. The narrator mentioned many times throughout the film that many of the leading environmental organizations were doing nothing to shed light on the animal agriculture industry, and I think that this film's purpose was to do that, as well as call out these organizations. This film left me with disbelief. I found it difficult to believe that these leading environmental groups were not bringing to light one of the leading environmental issues because of possible ties to the agriculture business, fear of political power, and because they thought people would no longer support their “business” because it went against their daily lifestyles.   think that it would be nearly impossible to have everybody shift their diets in a quick manner to vegetarian or vegan, but I think with films like these people would be more inclined to try. After watching this film, I feel slightly less enthusiastic about the organizations I thought supported the same things I did and a little more wary of their intentions and who really supports them financially.

I also was frustrated hearing about the organizations that I thought were on our side and how they fail to mention the impacts of food and agriculture industries. Cowspiracy reminded me how complex the climate crisis really is, and how there aren’t many people on either side who are 100% right or wrong. This film led me to the same conclusion as usual, that politics are too intertwined with every aspect of our lives and are making our fight for climate action so much harder.

To answer Ken’s question, I believe Kip Anderson's incorrect facts definitely undercut him and makes him seem less credible. The way that the documentary is set up almost seems a bit too dramatic and takes the focus away from his main mission it seems. Despite how I feel about the documentary in an artistic sense, I do have to appreciate it for getting me to think. This film got me to really think about why agriculture is destroying the planet and for what reason are people not willing to let the public know. 
                     <br><br>

Some of the facts in this documentary really surprised me, such as the Amazon being destroyed at 1 acre per second. That fact was very hard for me to digest, it just seems so insane, and to think that the main reason is because of agriculture was even more shocking. 
                     <br><br>

At times in the film, I got just as frustrated as Anderson when all of these ‘green’ organizations were going quiet when asked about the impacts of agriculture on the planet. As the film progressed, it showed a more dark side of the climate crisis, which was politics. Unfortunately, the big corporations will always have a say when it comes to politics because they fund many politicians and use them as puppets for their own gain. This film had me questioning whether this will remain an intrinsic part of our democracy, and if not what can we do to further make our voices heard not only in the US but across the globe?

After watching "cowspiracy", the documentary said that the share of greenhouse gases produced by animal husbandry was as high as 51%, rather than 15% as the scientific community said. This topic shocked me. Although this is 51% which also includes carbon dioxide produced by animal and plant respiration, this 51% is not recognized by the scientific community. In any case, the number is amazing, and livestock produces a lot of methane, which has a 25 times greater impact on global warming than carbon dioxide. And the movie mentions that only 5% of the total water is used by households in the United States, while 55% is used for livestock. The movie also mentions that making a hamburger takes 660 gallons of water, equivalent to two months of shower time. I often see people's death in some countries or cities because of drought in the news. We should not use these water resources to help people in need, but to develop animal husbandry. And in order to develop animal husbandry, people cut down a lot of trees, animals will also discharge a lot of waste, resulting in river pollution. All these reasons have led to the destruction of the environment and accelerated global warming.

These statistics startled me too. I had known for a long time that animal agriculture was terrible for the environment (and also ethical reasons), so I became vegetarian a little over 1.5 years ago. However, I had never really focused on the vast negative influence that dairy and egg farming have on the environment as well. I do hope to become vegan someday, but the circumstances that I live in now make that slightly tricky. Being on a campus meal plan, there are very few dairy/egg alternatives offered. The vegetarian selection is amazing, so that hasn't been difficult, but it would be hard to be satiated and healthy if I became vegan right now. But, I'm trying my best and I think if everyone made even just easy dietary changes, environmental conditions would be much better. 
                     <br><br>

The fact that the animal farming industry has so many incredibly destructive downsides, and people still eat incredibly meat heavy diets (209 pounds per year!!) is unbelievable. The imagery of what farming is needs to be showed to everyone. The disconnect from where our food comes from is allowing the terrible practices to continue. Ignorance is bliss and that bliss needs to be changed to acknowledgement and action.

Before watching the film “Cowspiracy” I had no idea about the controversies surrounding the statistics used in the documentary. Nonetheless, I do not believe that learning the fact that 15% rather than 51% of greenhouse emissions are from farm-based agriculture changes the core message of this film. Kip Andersen is trying to convey to the audience the importance of switching to a plant-based diet and the overwhelming amount of evidence of environmentalists trying to avoid the topic of farm-based agriculture as a leading cause of greenhouse emissions. Although, I have to say that finding out there is an erroneous statistic makes me question if there are any other misleading statistics. However, the responses from environmentalists and CEOs of environment organizations were more than enough in the documentary to prove to me that farm animals are playing a big role in polluting our world and are a major source of emissions. I found it almost comical every time a interviewer tried to avoid the questions Andersen asked about the meat industry. It is very evident that they are dodging the question because saying the truth could harm their image, organization, and even personal safety. It is a scary thought that the meat industry is so powerful in the United States that it can silence even the VP when it comes to environmental issues and its impacts on the environment. 
                      <br><br>
There were certain statistics that were definitely eye-opening throughout the documentary. The fact that 2,500 gallons of water are needed to produce one pound of beef is mind-boggling. We often hear that poor children and people are starving and dying of thirst. It is unbelievable that all of this water and grains that could be used to feed the starving population is being fed to cattle and other farm animals. These farm animals will then be slaughtered and sold to the rich, creating a perpetual cycle of poverty and hunger. The environmental impacts were also surprising, such as, “an acre of rainforest is cleared every second for farm-based agriculture.” Learning how coyotes, wolves, and horses were being killed in the wild to make space for ranching was incredibly sad. The biggest shock factor was when the backyard farmer slaughtered his ducks. I could not even look at my screen during that scene and it was truly horrifying and real to witness how our meat is produced. Kip says something that I believe we were all thinking when he states that it becomes more personal when we remember that all our meat comes from an animal who is slaughtered. At the end of the documentary, there are statistics that list off the benefits a person can make for being a vegan per day, “you can save 1100 gallons of water, 45 lbs of grain, 30 sqft of forest, and reduce 20lbs of CO2.” This is more than enough reason for me to try and pursue a life of veganism. Ken also mentioned an interesting term that I had never heard before, “freegan.” I am not sure how to spell this term, but it is a very interesting concept. The thought of eating discarded food seems disgusting, but on second thought, it wouldn’t be that bad if it was just food that no one bought or wasn’t contaminated. Preventing food waste and eating a largely plant-based diet is something that I really want to strive to accomplish every day.

Honestly, the lies (misconceptions?) in Cowspiracy really did put a sour taste in my mouth. The narrator went to every major climate organization to grill them on animal agriculture, quoted wrong statistics at them, played ominous music over it, and painted them as conspiratorial villains when they denied his (very, very false!!) statistics. While it WAS suspicious that they seemed to not focus at all on animal agriculture, the sheer over-exaggeration of everything the narrator did really got on my nerves and hurt the message of his film. He seemed to imply at most points that we shouldn't even be focusing on fossil fuels, and should only be caring about animal agriculture. That is insane, and it was right for the environmental organizations to disagree with him on this! Whenever one of them said that there were so many issues and there couldn't be just one major one, they were correct and should not be shamed for that opinion. There was just something deeply grating to me about how misleading this documentary's first half was. 
                     <br><br>

Still, though, that doesn't devalue it entirely. While reading comments about Wasted! do seem to imply it's a very good film, Cowspiracy does have its merits. Its second half, especially, is an important view into factory farming, environmental degradation, and all of the tiny little things that we don't notice that come out of agriculture. It explains externalities and their costs, it talks about water usage (I think) accurately... 
                     <br><br>

Eh, you know what, I'm forcing myself to talk about it positively. I didn't like this film. It's the first movie from this class I've actively disliked, and I'm honestly annoyed that it is THE major animal-agriculture documentary that is nearly a household name. It's doing the movement a disservice, and I just wish it was better.


<br><hr>
I agree with the points you bring up about how Cowspiracy is in many ways dishonest. This piece, as most climate change documentaries are, is propaganda. And part of its rhetoric is alarmism. 
                     <br><br>


To address the point Ken brings up about the filmmakers use of incorrect facts, I think it harms his credibility. I believe that credibility is one of the most important things in the fight against Climate Change, without credibility, we cannot change the minds of those we need to change the most. Simply electing progressive candidates and enacting changes means nothing if 4 or 8 years later, all of it gets rolled back in the next administration. We need to be able to convince the majority of our populace that climate change is a pressing issue. I feel like this film is attempting to communicate to mainly a youth audience. However, it comes off … very poorly, with one of the first lines being “it scared the emojis out of me.” The fact about how we would exceed our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, without even considering gas/oil/fuel due to raising and eating livestock is hard to believe. Because of the rest of the inaccuracies in the film … I wonder how accurate that fact is though. The fact about humans and our livestock making up 98% of the biomass is wildly inaccurate by the way. Earthworms alone, make up 56% of terrestrial biomass. I found the cognitive dissonance in the cattle ranchers to be interesting, I can’t quite reconcile valuing the animals as living intelligent creatures, and then turning around and eating them. However, I respect that they are involved in the process, I find people that consume meat, but wouldn’t be willing to kill the animal themselves to be hypocritical. I found it shocking that cows ate between 140-150 pounds of feed every single day. That’s about as much as I weigh, in feed, every single day. I struggled to conceptualize how agriculture could be this devastating, but seeing that fact put into perspective how bad dairy really is for our environment. I found the information on how the government subsidizes livestock raising through things such as helicopter usage to kill predators to be an effective rhetorical tool for convincing the audience. 
                     <br><br>


Overall I liked parts of the film, but the lack of credibility detracts from the message of the film. Overall the film left me with a negative impression due to its inaccuracies and the way the film portrays the various organizations.

<br><hr>
 I completely agree with your comment on your stance of the film Cowspiracy. I, too, was angry while watching this film. The incorrect information conveyed in this film partially discredits Kip Anderson in my opinion. This film definitely has over a million views, so the spread of misleading information to that many people is mind-boggling. I'm sure Anderson had a team full of producers and directors, and I'm just surprised that no one fact-checked all of this information. Another aspect about the film that irked me was how they blatantly showed the murder of the ducks. Whether you're a meat-lover, vegetarian, or vegan, no one can bear to view this gruesome clip. I wish they had inserted a warning for the audience so that we could at least be prepared for this scene. I'm surprised that Ken did not include a heads-up during lecture or on his website for his students. 

                     <br><br>

Despite these aspects of Cowspiracy, the message that they are communicating is meaningful. The major environmental corporations refused to open their eyes to the impacts of agriculture and livestock on the climate crisis. Often, when we think of the earth's climate crisis, fossil fuels and carbon-emissions are usually the front-runner causes. Now that we've learned that these corporations ignore livestock's impacts on climate change, it makes sense that the general public focuses on fossil fuels since that is what the environmental organizations are relaying to their audience. I hope that the impacts of animal production become as widely known as fossil fuels and carbon-emissions so that we can continue to take a step in the right direction.

What I’ve come to realize from watching, “Cowspiracy”, is that animal agriculture contributes to more than just methane emissions. It contributes to increased carbon dioxide emissions, water depletion, produces nitrogen oxides, and leads to deforestation, and overgrazing. This makes me even more upset at the fact that many of the organizations Kip talked to in the film were oblivious or declined to answer. The problem with animal agriculture is way more than just methane and climate change. If our government doesn’t care about the future of the planet and our environment that’s one thing, but what about a water crisis? The examples Kip showed were shocking. The almost insignificance in water saved from shorter showers versus enormous amounts of water used for the production of one hamburger or one pound of beef.
                     <br><br>
A personal connection I had to this documentary came when Kip started to talk about the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. I posted a picture of the girl scout cookies I bought(thin mints and tagalongs), because I didn’t know they were vegan and was so excited when I found out! Someone commented on my picture and said, “it’s great they are vegan but they still use palm oil, which tears down the Amazon rainforest.” I was shocked because I immediately felt guilty because of how important the Amazon rainforest is and because I had no idea palm oil was made for the environment. Now I know after watching “Cowspiracy”, that palm oil used 26 million acres compared to livestock cleared 136 million acres of rainforest. That’s over five times more! I understand that no one can be perfectly sustainable in the way they eat, but I think this person was a victim of propaganda. Just as Kip investigated on the organizations website, they only outlined palm oil, coal, pulp & paper, and tar sands. Cattle ranching was nowhere to be found, when it is in fact the number one cause of rainforest loss.

I think you make a great point about looking at the environmental impacts of animal agriculture (and any other activity) more holistically. A lot of people get wrapped up in the connection between industrial meat production and climate change and neglect all of the other ways in which it is devastating the environment, our health, and the lives of animals. I understand when certain "environmentalists" prioritize emissions-caused climate change on their list of environmental concerns, but there are so many other issues to tackle as well. Maybe animal agriculture isn't the leading cause of anthropogenic climate change, but is a massively destructive industry in a variety of other ways. As highlighted in the film, water and land use is one of the most critical concerns considering how much of our resources are spent raising livestock. The film also talks about animal waste, which is an often overlooked issue of animal agriculture. Livestock waste is often mismanaged and ends up contaminating waterways or sits in waste lagoons and devastates the soil around it. This waste contamination can choke marine ecosystems and cause eutrophication and hypoxia, killing marine life. And going beyond the environmental element of industrial meat production, we should also consider the ethical implications. This might not translate to people who lack moral capacities and hearts, but it should be noted regardless. Industrial animal agriculture is slavery, torture, oppression, and just flat out inhumane.

After watching “Cowspiracy, I’ve come to realize the same detrimental impacts as you. Through this film, it brought up really important information that has been so well-guarded from the public that so many people fail to see how animal agriculture is the 2nd most polluting industry in the world. I have similar feelings about how you felt regarding how organizations approached the questions Kip asked them about animal agriculture. I think what shocked me the most was how Oceana was basically advocating for overfishing even though the marine species are depleting as a result of it. What frustrated me the most was watching how so many of the environmental organizations in which are informing people to be more aware of how their human behaviors are affecting the environment are not doing the same in regards as to how they are not holding the animal agriculture accountable for polluting the earth and causing mass extinction of plants and animals by deforestation and overgrazing cattle. So I agree with what you said regarding how insignificant it is informing the public to conserve water when domestic use of water only takes up to 5% of fresh water use compared to 55% of fresh water that animal agriculture uses. The animal agriculture industry are constantly blaming the fossil fuel industry to stray attention away from their actions because if the public actually knew what goes on on a daily basis, they would lose profit. I think “Cowspiracy '' did a good deed for the American people in regards as to how detrimental animal agriculture really is to the environment and mankind as a whole.

I totally agree with your point of view after watching the film "Cowspiracy", which showing audience that animal agriculture contributes this much to CO2 emission and methane emission which lead to climate crisis. Comparing to water crisis, the future of our planet is obviously a more serious problem. Not saying that water crisis is not significant, but in contrast not as important as the climate crisis which might lead to extinction of lots of species, including human beings. 
                     <br><br>
The example you provided is very interesting, and related to the topics we talked about in the last several lectures. Although palm oil is still used for vegans, and this is still hurtful to the amazon rainforest, it is already a huge step for planet savers to decide become a vegetarian. As what you mentions, no one can be perfectly sustainable in the way they eat, so the thing we can do is to improve step by step. Things will get better if we all try our best and make improvements everyday.

Based on the in class lectures and discussions I was made aware that the agricultural sector produced a massive amount of greenhouse gases. The statement at the beginning of the film that says how raising cows produces more than the entire transportation sectors that we are constantly told are doing lots of damage. Yet in the news or  in daily life people do not talk much about how a heavy meat based diet is  a big contribution to the climate crisis. I was also shocked to hear that fracking uses 100 billion gallons of water, but compared to the 34 trillion gallons of water used in raising livestock in the U.S. I could not believe it. For the amount of coverage that fracking and oil industries get for being the cause of the climate crisis you would think the bigger agricultural problem would be discussed even more. Seeing all the negative impacts that livestock raising for sustaining the meat consumption such as taking so much fresh water, a large amount of land, causing destruction to the amazons, and extinction  of species  really set a new perspective of the true damage caused by the agricultural sector.
                      <br><br>

It is very concerning that even organizations whose focus is to save the planet are unaware of the main source of damage being the agricultural sector and livestock. They focus on other factors that are less pressing and are not as big of contributors to the climate crisis. Hearing the program director of Amazon Watch mention how many people who spoke up about the issue about the negative impact of the agricultural sector got killed was shocking yet believable. These huge industries want to preserve their businesses and want to keep the public unaware of this issue so that they can continue to profit. This reminds me of the fact that was discussed in lecture on how the cigar companies knew about the links to cancer as early as the 1950s yet it was not something discussed since it would hurt their profits. I hope that organizations that are truly for the cause of conserving the planet will unite against the agricultural sector’s impact on the climate crisis. I think that although very difficult and perhaps even dangerous, that the public has the right to know at what cost their daily meat consumption comes at. Maybe after knowing the fact they would be more inclined in  it not removing at least reducing the amount of meat they consume.

This film changed my life. I have decided to go vegan after watching Cowspiracy today. I used to be vegan, for many many months. I gave it up because it was hard. However, after watching this film— seeing the slaughter of the birds, hearing about the slaughter of the cows and pigs, hearing the statistics of how much emissions the animal agriculture industry contributes to our global carbon footprint, and the blatant disregard for human, environmental and animal rights by these supposed environmentalist organizations and our governments— has made me decide to make the permanent change. I just went to Albertsons and bought fruits, original Lays, and other meatless alternative foods. There’s many meatless foods that look and taste like actual animal product foods. They’re healthier and more sustainable. I highly suggest people try them. One quote from the movie really stood out to me. The vegan man saying that cow’s milk is for turning baby calfs from 65 pound babies to 400 pound adult cows— not for human consumption. That really stood out to me because it’s true. Women produce milk for their babies. We don’t give human breast milk to animals, so why should we consume animal’s milk? Cowspiracy? By far the best film we’ve watched in this class so far, and the most important. Thank you Ken.

I might be quite atrocious at cooking, but nonetheless food has always been such an important thing in my life. For me, I've always viewed food as a comfort in particular. I felt most myself when being able to indulge my sense of taste, probably also my most outgoing. Perhaps a weird concept, but it still was something so important to my life and character, so obviously watching "Wasted!" really struck a chord with me. I've generally been pretty waste conscientious. My family owns chickens, not for food but just genuinely as pets, and we always would give our scraps to our chickens. I never really considered how other people rid of their waste just due to my own personal convenience, but honestly, it's actually shocking how 90% of the waste we produce goes into landfills when this film presents so many more viable options. 

                      <br><br>

Honestly, it just doesn't even seem possible that we can dispose of waste in such as useless manner that we do. It just logically does not make sense. Who wouldn't want to start transforming waste into electricity when it saves so much money? Why wouldn't that be everyone's very FIRST instinct, as opposed to spending time and effort burying them in the ground that we're already losing in lengths to agriculture. Even making beer into bread sounds like something I would expect beer brewers to be jumping on, because again, it just sounds like the smartest option. Who would actually want to add trash to the landfill when it has to benefit to anyone other than to pollute the earth.

                      <br><br>

I think my favorite parts of the film were witnessing how these chefs go through their creative process, particularly with Dan Barber and Danny Bowien, who are working towards make such unique dishes. I loved seeing them use such strange ingredients, that really aren't very strange in the grand scheme of things, such as cauliflower leaves, things I never even remotely considered as being edible. I felt that this film took a very new approach to one of the huge issues in climate change without being totally direct about it. It's food consciousness, without even necessarily having to go vegan, about how we dispose of that waste. This film actually gave ways in which to solve the problem with real life examples without just pointing out the facts. It quite possible could be one of my favorite films that we've covered, especially with delving into something I hold so dearly to me.

This film “Cowspiracy” should be presented to all who deny that beef industries will produce co2. These organizations which claim themselves green are words of deception, just like what VG said when selling their diesel cars. Cow industries are not only polluting industries but also are water wasting industries. Animals in those farms use 55% of total water usage in America which is insane. 
                      <br><br>

People need to know that each burger they ate is harming the planet. The government should ask animal farms to decrease the amount of animal that they cultivate and promote fish-eating diet including river fish.

Hello, I absolutely agree with you that “Cowspiracy” could viably persuade individuals who believe that the beef industry isn’t impacting our planet. It’s unfortunate to see that climate change deniers still take this stance when films like “Cowspiracy” exist. Similarly, I agree that more people need to view films like this to really open their eyes and understand the gravity of the situation. The beef industry is simply worsening our collective problem too much. Hopefully, more people take on a healthy and more environmentally- friendly diet after watching this documentary.

Well other than the fact that I almost threw up during the beheading of the duck and couldn't help but cringe at some of his statistics (I knew that most of his numbers were wrong because they blatantly exaggerated the ones provided by Ken), I felt trapped. Although this film must have been revolutionary in its debut, I feel as if the damage of the beef and dairy industry is now public knowledge. Maybe it is because I went to high-school in California, but every year we had some volunteers come in during one of our English classless and talk precisely about this. Among other factors, such as reading Walden, it was one of these talks early in high-school that made me switch from my choice of the daily burger at the lunch cafeteria. 
                      <br><br>

Back then, my choice was simple. Given the underfunded school lunch program, the salads provided were miserable and the only other options were misery meat tacos and McDonald's quality burgers. So, can't eat the only eatable option on the menu? Simple, I got out of school two hours later so I could simply wait until I got out and eat at home. Now I'm presented with a dilemma. I personally despise the salads at the dining commons. The black bean burgers are amazing and so are their pastas, but there are days where they have neither. In fact, during most dinners at DLG where I personally think the food options are generally worse than their lunch counterparts, the only appetizing food options often contain meat. I have gone from a completely egg, fish, and vegetable diet to essentially having meat at half of my meals in less than a year. I really want to help the planet and go vegetarian every time I eat out but I am finding it very hard here. 
                      <br><br>


I commented earlier in the year on how I was slowly adjusting back to a vegetarian diet after not following it for the most part of fall quarter, but now im burnt out. There's only so many badly seasoned beans and cheese pizza I can eat when nothing else looks good; which is unfortunately too often at the dining commons.

*I watched "Wasted!" because I saw "Cowspiracy" last quarter for English 22.
                      <br><br>
"Use everything, waste nothing." One of the interviewees in the very beginning of the film stated these words, and although it's a relatively short quote, it speaks volume on just how much we waste food, which then releases methane into the atmosphere. Although it is something that is easier said than done, it is vital that we implement this lifestyle of utilizing everything to the maximum while wasting as little as possible.
                      <br><br>
The documentary was extremely educational and provided many shocking statistics as well. One key point an interviewee brought up was how we have over 9 billion people in this world, yet people still go hungry at night, and that highlights how much of a problem food waste is. With 40% of the food we purchase going to waste, it has unfortunately become a habit of us to throw away any leftovers instead of composting.
                      <br><br>
The documentary, however, took a positive turn by showcasing organizations that are helping to decrease the amount of food waste. For example, the documentary featured an organization called The Daily Table, and they help recover food from supermarkets that would have been thrown away, including locally grown foods and vegetables from nearby farms and farmer markets. The people working for the organization explained that supermarkets hold the most power in the food industry, as they motivate consumers to buy food that they might not even need. As a result, the average American family wastes roughly $1500 simply on food.
                      <br><br>
Personally, the most inspiring organization the documentary featured was the Green's Edible Schoolyard, which is a part of an elementary school located in Tennessee. The elementary school students here would learn how to grow their own food, so that they would be discouraged from wasting food; if they have any leftovers, they were taught to put them in composting bins to put back into the soil later. In addition, these students began to eat healthy vegetables that they grew instead of chips and candy because they learned a sense of responsibility of the plants they grow. Watching them made me want to start growing my own vegetables, and helped me realize that if this program was implemented in all elementary schools across the nation, the US would be doing significantly better in fighting the crisis.

I agree with you that the film offers staggering statistics which really helps emphasize the point that not only is food waste harmful for the environment, it is unethical and even criminal, given how many people goes to sleep hungry everyday.
                      <br><br>

I also really like that the film isn't entirely cynical and depressing but rather has an optimistic aspect to it as well. The Daily Table helps reduce food waste and proves that eating healthy doesn't have to be expensive while the Green's Edible Schoolyard taught me a lot about having respect and a sense of gratitude for the food that I'm eating and where it comes from.
                      <br><br>

One thing that stands out to me the most from this film is the idea that what is food and what is garbage is all about perception. It's crazy how back then, lobsters used to be fed to prisoners and now they're one of the most expensive dishes you can order at a restaurants. It really goes to show that the value of the food we're eating isn't about where they come from or what they look like but rather what we make of them. I have so much respect for the chefs that are using the food scraps and turning them into delicacies, encouraging a rethinking of our habits and attitudes towards food.


<br><hr>
 I agree! I also have a lot of respects for chefs that are working to be environmentally friendly; I think it is fascinating how they are able to think of new dishes that aren't just tasty and healthy, but also help the environment as well. 
                      <br><br>
I also agree on how the documentary ended on a relatively positive note, which is really nice for a change since many of the documentaries we watched in the first half of the class was discouraging and depressing. The Daily Table and Green's Schoolyard definitely can bring so much inspiration to other schools and help others to be environmentally friendly as well; it's really fascinating how these organizations are fighting the crisis in a fun and educational way. 
                      <br><br>
I also agree that it's crazy how we don't value food as much as we should; I didn't know that lobsters were fed to prisoners, and that's really shocking that it used to occur. I think that if we grew our own food, like those students did at Green's, we would definitely understand how valuable our food is and work even harder to make sure we don't have leftovers.

Cowspiracy is a film that I have heard a lot about in the past. In fact, it is a film that has made many of my friends go vegan/vegetarian. I can now see why my friends made these choices. It was really frustrating watching Anderson go to multiple organizations to speak about agricultural issues, and he would simply be ignored or blown off. In showing this, we were able to see how problematic the subject of agriculture production was. I found it interesting when Ken pointed out that there was a mistake in saying that animal production causes 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. Instead the correct statistic should be 15%. This incorrect fact makes it hard to have trust in this documentary. The difference between the two statistics is pretty large. It seems as though the makers of this film made this mistake intentionally to try to make the situation seem a lot worse. However, I do agree animal production is terrible for the environment and needs to be cut back. This was the film’s overall conclusion and I couldn’t agree more. This is not to say that everyone should stop eating meat as a whole, because that would be unrealistic. However, if we were to cut back on our consumption we could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This will have a positive impact on our planet and even our own health. This film was extremely difficult to watch and I definitely had to stop watching at some points during the film. I especially found the scene of the dairy factories. Like a lot of other students in class, I was taken aback and upset. I don’t know if this film will make me completely change my lifestyle to be vegetarian/vegan, but I think it has definitely shown me that I need to cut back my meat intake. With that being said I am going to try to limit the animal products I consume not only for our environment, but also my own health.

This movie was........ interesting. Although he's right about the meat industry, he made every interview a "gotcha!" moment instead of trying to actually inform people and get help. I know that many of the barriers he encountered were real, but the least he could do is treat experts with the respect they deserve. Watching him talk to female leaders of ecological companies made me cringe. He is very judgmental in his interviews, and it makes me wonder how he thought things were going to go. I think that the meat industry can and still does have to exist. Most people don't want to stop eating meat altogether. Showing people how to reduce their meat consumption through plant based dishes is much more feasible for getting people to eat better for themselves and their world. There are so many changes that need to happen within the meat industry.
                      <br><br>
The idea of being "freegan" is actually really interesting to me. The stigma surrounding it will probably deter me from the practice in all honesty, but I knew through prior research that the problem of waste is huge. We have enough food, globally, to end world hunger twice or three times. It's corporate greed that keeps this precious food just out of reach of those who need it most. If food could be distributed correctly throughout the world, sustainable farming would be so much more possible because farmers would know how much food to grow. We don't need to be expanding like this.

When I started to watch the film “Cowspiracy” I had no idea what this documentary was going to be about. I have to say I had no idea that there was so much controversy and shaky facts being released. That being said I knew that cows and animal agriculture was bad for our environment, but I did not know why. I assumed it was mainly because of the amount of methane they release per day and because methane is more potent than CO2, and the deforestation that occurs in order to make these pastures is another reason I came up with. Although it never crossed my mind that the amount of water it takes to keep these cattle alive, as well as all of the water it takes to make those cows into various products like hamburgers and steaks. I know the way these animals raised to be food for us are treated terribly and have horrible inhumane ways of killing them. Even though it makes me sad and disgusted to hear and see these things, it never was enough to get me to want to stop eating meat. Which I know makes me sound like a horrible person, but for some reason whenever I looked at a burger I was eating I never thought “oh this was a cow I bet it was treated terribly.” Recently after taking numerous environmental-related classes, I do want to cut meat out of my diet because of the effects the industry has on the environment. The thought used to scare me, I used to wonder if I was even capable of being a vegetarian, but I now realize that the way this industry affects our planet and our environment scares me more than changing my diet.

Apology in advance, I didn't realize I used my personal account to post earlier. I've switched to my school account... 
                      <br><br>
Like you, I knew that cows were bad for the environment, but I didn’t know it was because of land use and all the water that they needed throughout their lifetime. As oblivious as it sounds, I originally thought it was all because of the methane they produced. One thing that threw me off was the fact that he mentioned animal agriculture is responsible for 51% of greenhouse gas production, but I learned after watching Ken’s video, it was actually 15%. Even though he provided the incorrect statistics, I still believe his intention for making the documentary. In terms of deforestation, the documentary took up a huge segment on free-range and grass-fed beef. Even though the owners made it seem like it’s more humane, after the calculations were shown, the method was not sustainable. We would still need to convert all the different landscapes across US to make them into grasslands in order to make this work and that is impossible. I was shocked to hear that the pro-livestock spokesperson said that livestock had individualized care. It was so ironic that the documentary was putting clips of livestock being maltreated on the side in comparison. Even in the beginning, I learned the fact that 200 quick showers will get you one small burger and that ratio was just not right. Recently, I’ve been seeing more and more celebrities promote veganism and I think it’s a great way for the general public to witness. One quote from the film will always be in the back of my head and it was “you can’t call yourself an environmentalist if you’re eating meat.”


<br><hr>
I was equally as shocked at how much damage the agriculture business is truly doing to the environment, not only in regards to its greenhouse emissions, but also in relation to the other effects such as deforestation and overuse of water. I was astonished at how most of the supposed environmentalist groups interviewed danced around the subject of agriculture and usually did not even choose to acknowledge it as a major contributor to climate change. It was startling to me to understand that we produce enough food for 12-15 billion people, yet there are millions consistently going hungry, as much of this food is put towards feeding agriculture. That alone seems like a direct example of the selfishness and ignorance of wealthier countries, as we have the means to fix world hunger but instead we put these efforts towards more (unnecessary) food for ourselves. Another side of this issue that I had not really thought much about before was the overfishing (or just fishing) of our oceans. Up until watching this film, I figured, like was mentioned that many others often do, that the fish taken out of the ocean will just repopulate and there is no harm done to these fish populations. However, I can see now that this is a completely false sense of the situation, and it isn’t even just the edible / targeted fish populations that are damaged, but countless others (bycatch) along with the underwater environment. The part that caused me to look most introspectively was the discussion of how “meatless Mondays”, although somewhat beneficial, is truly only false justification and an excuse to feel better about eating meat the other six days of the week. Further, the idea that one cannot call themselves an environmentalist if they still eat meat hit close to home, as I did believe I was a climate supporter myself, but I now understand I do this under false pretenses. Therefore, I have decided to take baby steps toward becoming vegetarian in hopes of slowly integrating this diet change into my life.



<br><hr>
As someone who merely only eats meat and hasn't voluntarily touched a vegetable in years (yes I have a child palate), I also agree with how you felt about eating meat. Not once have I ever thought when eating a steak that a cow was abused and beaten for its body, and after watching the butchering of the duck in the movie, my mind has changed. Although I know that i will not stop eating meat, it makes me think deeper on the real repercussions that our actions have even without our knowledge. Animals are being abused and extorted at the expense of our enjoyment, and yet it still goes to waste. Even moreso, if we stopped eating animals and feeding them, worldwide hunger would not be a problem! That was the most surprising fact of it all in terms of the movie. If the world collectively stopped eating meat, then we would not have to feed animals, and there will be more than enough food to feed everyone on the planet an adequate diet. In the movie, someone said that "if we have enough resources to feed corn to a cow, then why can't we feed corn to a human?" The solutions are right in front of us, and yet we have done nothing to try and save them. It is quiet idiotic that we know how to save our planet and yet we still sit here and act like we have no idea how to go about it. By collectively pushing to stop eating meat, we not only save the planet from the release of tons of greenhouse gases being expedited, but we can SOLVE worldwide hunger! It's basically killing the two largest birds with one stone at the clear expense of no one, and we have done nothing to put forth and try to solve it. I don't feel bad for the human race because we know what we're doing, and we know how to stop. We just haven't figured out when. But by the time we do, it will be too late.

The film Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret completely left me in awe about what happens in the agricultural business and how unaware the public is about it. The reason we don’t know is because activists leave their lives at risk when speaking out on these large corporations and the way they function. There are organizations such as Greenpeace who did not even meet with these film makers, potentially, because of this reason. Information is power and large agricultural businesses withholding so much of it is scary because this affects everyone and everything on the planet, yet, they continue to run business despite knowing so. It is all for profit but how far will they let it go? 
                        <br><br>
  I personally come from a rural area where agriculture is the main income for the county. I have seen these high statistics on public health complications such as asthma and poor eye-sight that are a result of agricultural business actions. Besides that, the area is in the middle of the desert so the heat only makes it worse. Agricultural changes must be made in order to improve lives, especially of those who are first-handedly exposed to these actions. Not just as an environmentalist but as a living being, people need to understand that the choices that we make everyday have a greater impact farther than we can even imagine. Awareness is important but so is taking action. 
                        <br><br>
  What I ESPECIALLY cannot get out of my head is the dairy business. From a young age I remember the posters and signs hung at my school: “Got Milk?” Teacher aids would stand next to the milk container to make sure each child would get a milk carton. We are told it makes our bones strong so we can grow healthily. Yet, milk is not something a human being should even be consuming. We are brainwashed from the beginning of our lives  that something is good for us or won’t cause harm, when in fact it can in the long term. Dairy, meat, cigarettes .... What else are we being lied to about that we are not aware holds deep consequences yet?

After watching the "Cowspiracy" documentary, I felt like the worst person on earth. The one fact mentioned in "Cowspiracy" that has really stuck with me is the fact about how if we took all of the grain that fed the cows and fed humans with it, it could really help fight world hunger tremendously. This is extremely powerful as it really made me reconsider if eating beef is worth it. I felt like if I ate beef, then I was taking food away from those who are hungry. It's an indirect way of not sharing the resources. Honestly, every day goes by and I begin to realize how easy it is to cut down meat in my diet. Slowly and slowly, eating beef became a shameful and unappealing concept to me. This documentary really opened my eyes to the ways in which the agriculture industry controls the economy and the environment.

I can definitely relate to that feeling after watching “Cowspiracy”. It brought up so many negative impacts that are happening to our planet because of the agriculture industry that I had never even thought of before. It’s kinda crazy to me honestly, that I never stopped to think about all of the water that goes into feeding the animals that we later consume, meaning that all of this water is technically being used up by us. I knew, mostly because Ken has stated it in the past, that reducing our consumption of meat is necessary to improve climate change, but I truly was not aware of the specific reasons why. After watching this film, however, I feel much more informed.
                        <br><br>

A big part of the film that stood out to me was when it was stated that “if you want to call yourself an environmentalist, you should not be consuming any type of animal products at all.” I related to the reaction of the narrator as he discussed how he felt stopping his consumption of animal products sounded like it was going to be difficult. I, too, feel the same way as I have grown up my entire life consuming animal products. However, as you stated, starting slow and progressively developing a vegan diet really shouldn’t be that hard. Maybe it will be difficult at first, but I definitely want to continue limiting my consumption of animal products until eventually I am including none in my diet, as I want to be able to consider myself an environmentalist.

I have a video on my phone that I used to think was pretty funny. It’s a video of me and my brother skating behind a Krispy Kreme in Fayetteville, NC, that had a dumpster overflowing with what appeared to be perfectly fine donuts. Now, I look at the video, and I’m a little bit disheartened. What once stood out as a funny memory to me (look, a donut graveyard haha), now stands out as a clear mark of the extremely wasteful society we live in. Everyday, Popeyes throws away its leftover chicken. Taco Bell tosses out whatever salad, tomatoes, and other variety of foods it didn’t use. Pizza hut tosses its boxed pizzas that, had it been an hour earlier, they would have sold into the trash. DLG throws out probably two cows worth of burgers at the end of the day just on account of wanting to serve a surplus. This is mirrored in the movie, where it targets the laws and structures in place that allow us to have way too much food produced, and therefore way too much food tossed out. While sometimes they might sound crazy, the video I have of the back of Krispy Kreme makes Freegans look like they might be onto something. Waste not and want not.

I thought the film was effective in communicating its message. It provided daunting statistics, and while they may have been slightly off, they still convey the drastic situation at hand with animal agriculture. Additionally, interviews with powerful people/corporations and intense scenes help further illustrate the issue. My initial reacting was shock. When I think of what is hurting our planet, I usually imagine corporations polluting, not animal agriculture. Another reaction I feel is anger at the hypocrisy of those who advocate for improving our planet but secretly prioritize their own profits and gains. I learned about how livestock causes more carbon emissions than even the transportation industry. The film made me somewhat pessimistic about the future, as even those who seemingly are working on saving the planet have their own agendas. It has made me question the people who claim to be on our side and has inspired me to do more of my own research and investigation.I think the intended audience is casual viewers who are totally unaware of the impact animal agriculture is having on our environment. This movie may also be directed towards people who are invested in improving our environment and ending pollution/degradation. I would definitely recommend this film to a friend, as I believe it can open a lot of eyes the way it did to me.

I agree that though the statistics were off, it didn't take away from the message of the film drastically. Though some of the numbers were wrong, they were still substantial and shocking. I, like you, always envisioned the burning of fossil fuels, transportation, etc., when I thought of the major causes of climate change. After watching Cowspiracy, I wondered if the reason I thought that way was because of how promoters of the issue avoid bringing up agriculture. Seeing these interviews where influential people apart of these green organizations go blank when asked about the meat industry shocked me. There's no evidence or excuse to not talk about this leading cause of climate change, and they're left blank when asked about it. It's truly horrifying that even the organizations we think are trying to "save our world" can still be swayed by power. 1 hamburger equates to showering for 2 months, yet these organizations will still tell you to turn off the sink when brushing your teeth. It's our job, our minds--the ones money or government can't reach--that must inform people about what the true issue is.

<p>
I found Cowspiracy both incredibly informative but also extremely frustrating to watch. I was not at all aware of the role that animal agriculture plays in climate change. According to Kip Andersen, animal agriculture is responsible for 51% of anthropogenic climate change, as well as consuming 30% of water on earth, occupying 45% of the entire planet’s land, and destroying 91% of the Amazon rainforest. These statistics were frightening to hear, but what was even more so was the fact that even our government and the directors of the most prominent environmental organizations in the U.S. fail to mention or even deny the impact of animal agriculture on climate change. And the reason for that? These groups need funding and membership, and if they start promoting anti-meat campaigns, they might lose their funding. It’s unbelievable.
                        <br><br>


If these organizations and the government actually cared about the environment they so adamantly claim to protect, why not educate their members about the impact of the meat and dairy industries? I understand they need funding to keep working, but it’s selfish to try to preserve an organization that isn’t even promoting the right problems and solutions in the first place.
                        <br><br>


Much of this film scared me. Our planet is dying, and people are still being selfish and ignorant about their decisions. It scared me how big of an impact eating a single burger has on the earth, how little people know about the effects of animal agriculture, and how worst of all, the people who have the power to do something about it would rather collect their funding than focus on what’s important. 
                        <br><br>


Obviously, all the changes we need to make to our lifestyles, including clothes, food, transportation, etc. are going to have rough transitions. But it’s what we need, and it's infuriating to see that there is not nearly enough being done about it.

I really understand what you are concerned about. This movie uses a lot of professional data and interviews with many experts to explain how animal husbandry can cause environmental problems. The movie starts with Kip who is a common person who wants to protect the environment. When he thought he tried his best, he saw a post about risks of rearing cattle. Then he starts to find information about animal husbandry and uses many examples to explain his views. However, I think some data is exaggerated and unrealistic to some extent. Kip says that there is little information about animal husbandry that can cause environmental problems. If people do not care about the issues, it is hard for them to know these problems. And general viewers are hard to be persuaded if they think dairy and meat is essential to life. Actually, my reaction is intellectual. If human beings eat vegetarian food, it is bound to convert a large number of pastures into arable land. However, arable land is even more destructive to the natural environment. Not only should all ecological plants be removed, but crops have a great absorption and destruction effect on the land so that the land will not become barren after a few years. Moreover, there is also the problem of soil erosion and desertification. So the view from this film cannot persuade me for some instance. But from this film, I learn a lot of waste that we don’t care about in our daily life. When we think we have done something to protect our environment like saving water and reducing plastic bags, there are still a lot of things we can do. The film talks about a new thought about if we eat meat and dairy every day can produce more pollutants and waste on the environment. I am shocked that animal husbandry can destroy our environment. Although it is impossible for people to stop eating meat and dairy, we can pay more attention to this issue and do what we can do to protect our environment.

I really enjoyed watching Wasted!, I really think everyone should watch it. Whenever we think of climate activists we usually imagine young adults or climate scientists, but I was completely taken aback by the fact that it was chefs telling us about food waste. I think the way the film presented so many facts and statistics throughout the movie was a perfect way to add validity to the speakers. One fact that stood out to me was that we waste around 1.3 billion tons of food each year. It is crazy how we have so much food leftover, yet 1 in 5 kids don’t have enough food to eat. We don’t even have to look at statistics, just going to LA is enough to realize how much of a problem we have. The funny thing is that this problem could be solved. We could easily take this excess food and actually use it to feed people, feed animals, or even use it for energy. Even eating at the dining halls, it’s clear to see that we waste so much food in our everyday lives.

When watching Wasted!, I thought of the UCSB dining halls as well. Last year when I lived in Santa Catalina,  I often dined in the Portola dining hall. Even back then, when putting back the dishes, I realized how much food was still left on the plates and how much food was wasted. However, It wasn't until this documentary that I understood the entire chain of events that comes after wasting food. Of course, the obvious atrocity of wasting food is that there are millions of people out there in starvation and the food that we waste without a second thought could easily save so many. However, this documentary was enlightening to me because it focused on so many other drawbacks of wasting food, such as food ending up in landfills and emitting great amounts of methane. To avoid this, we can easily choose to compost and in turn, the food waste we compost will give back and provide us with electricity through aerobic energy. The bigger lesson I learned from this documentary is the fact that ultimately everything on this earth serves a purpose, even waste, and that we live in a constant cycle.

After watching Wasted!, too I was quite astonished with the fact that we go on and waste 1.3 billion tons of food every single year while an estimated 800 million people around the world are starving from a lack of food. It is purely insane to me how so much food is produced to just be wasted, from supermarkets and restaurants wanting fruits and vegetables in a desirable physical state (none that seem out of the ordinary because of misshape) which results in massive amount of food waste that lays waste in landfills, as here in the United States about 90% of food ends up in the landfills, producing methane gas, which from what we have learned is far more potent as a greenhouse gas than our beloved CO2 which is the main culprit of the climate crisis. What is also eye opening to me was the percentage ratio stated on whats used and not used on a cauliflower, where the users only use about 40% to sell off (doesn't mean it's eaten) and the other 60% is just waste and why don't we have the same respect for farmland as for the meat of animal?The wheat/corn belt in the United States produces tons and tons of food that goes to waste and could be put on sale elsewhere in the world but doesn't and ultimately made me feel frustrated because of the fact that a potential solution for worldwide hunger but it just ends up as wasted food and opportunity. 
                        <br><br>
Businesses like Daily Table are good for the fight against food waste because of the fact that it utilizes food that would have been wasted and prioritizes local farmers which is good for small town economies. Not only that it prioritizes a healthy diet in comparison to fast food business and supermarkets that  control the desire of food on the richest nations of the world. Also the use of bread to craft alcohol is a nifty idea as well that handles the food waste situation in a creative way. The use of food waste is also a clear solution as well with japan choosing specific food waste to feed there pig livestock which is a interesting idea that can be used in the United States where the BBQing scene is a major part of the cultural lifestyle and be a idea opened to many.
                        <br><br>
Yet, we don't implement this and watch the billions of food waste stack up in the landfills rather than the mouths of those starving world wide.

The film Wasted: The Story of Food Waste focuses on sustainability and providing the numerical facts behind the waste that people produce. In America, one trillion dollars are wasted equivalent to 40 percent of food waste while 1/5 Americans do not have enough to eat on a daily basis. Other countries also globally have food waste issues such as Britain and their 900,000 ton food waste on bread. Chef Dan Barber shows us different ways to maintain sustainability through cooking with ingredients that are usually wasted away. Ninety percent of American waste go to landfill which is also an issue because it releases chemicals into the environment in comparison to compost which can actually help the environment by giving back to the earth. The three solutions that were recommended to act in the end is to buy less, care, and be an active citizen.

 Each time I eat in the dorms, I immediately begin thinking what happens to all the remaining prepared food that remains once dinner times ends. These past few days, I have been trying to eat healthier in terms of vegetables and leave less waste on my plate each time I go to the cafeteria. It makes me feel sufficiently happier and energetic. Let me admit, I am human too, I have tendencies to want to do things in excess sometimes such as shopping. The temptation of wanting to be a consumer is so incorporated in our society throughout media and other sources in our life that it becomes almost addictive. It really makes me question our society for the things that we hold up to value.

Isn't it a shame that several of the mainstream organizations environmental awareness are informing the public solely on the issues of fracking, transportation, and ocean acidification. While they do a good job of racking up responses to the common practices of changing a lightbulb or turning off the faucet when not in use, leading environmentalist organizations fail to inform the public of the leading contributor to our carbon emissions. How could it be that the issue that continues to make the most detrimental effects on our Earth would be left out of almost every website that advocated for more sustainable living.

                        <br><br>

I cannot say I'm surprised to hear that even government agencies avoids mentioning the effects of the meat industry. This whole series of films and readings has come to sh0w just how every industry is in it for the money. It was a shame to know that quite often, the reasoning behind all this mess of misinformation is initiated by the desire to keep membership rates high and conflict low. "Cowspiracy" shares the motivation behind these acts of partial information. It was mentioned that once an organization, shares information concerning limiting our consumption of beef, they would be once labeled as "anti-meat"and thus, lose memberships and/or donors that were essentially crucial to keeping many of these organizations on two feet. 


                        <br><br>

This repeated notion that it's all about the profits is a common theme amongst several of the texts, films, and lessons we've learned from in this class. It's hard to think that the very organizations that claim to be spreading awareness, and saving the planet are ironically doing quite the opposite by hiding information worth knowing to the public. Its time we, as the american public, and the whole world even, have access to this information on the frontlines. Making a change NOW is our only hope before it becomes too late to act on our eating habits.

The purpose of the film was to convince people to give up meat essentially due to the effect it was having on the environment. But it did not have a great effect on me because I am already a vegetarian for personal reasons. People who are concerned about the environment could stand to learn a lot from this film because it shows how activist organizations may not be telling us the whole truth. The film mostly just changed my attitude towards organizations like Oceana. The fact that so many organizations did not even want to address the issue of meat and its effect on the environment was very surprising. It also taught me more about how seafood affects the environment which I did not know was a thing.

For me, the most impressive point of the film is to list the solutions to food waste. In fact, everyone can start from the way, reducing food waste and improving the effective use of food. I think food waste is much more common than co2 emission, since we cannot directly see it. The dining common would be the closest example for us. We can see the food were left in the plates, and not a little, a lot, more than the food you can eat. I always take the amount that a little bit lesser than I can definitely finish, even though I left a half cup of water in the end, I would choose to drink that. There is an old Chinese saying that I learned when I was young: every grain of the rice in the plate contains the hardship of farmers. You can clearly understand that it reminds people do not waste food. And also what should be reduced is not only food waste, but we can start from reducing food waste.

I experienced a whirlwind of emotions when watching Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret. I could not have been more furious in learning that the very heads of supposedly “conservationist groups' ' or NGOs laugh in the very face of the problem they are campaigning to solve. When the OCEANA director began chuckling at the statement, “We should stop spending money, we should stop fishing” I scoffed at his response. The man is probably educated and must’ve at one point cared about ocean and marine life enough to take the job but even he still laughs at the real problems we are facing. I grew even more angry when the film showed the family raising pigs and cattles. Humanity but especially children are caring. I don’t care what psychologists or philosophers say in that matter but I believe we have the basic and primitive instinct to care for other living beings. Therefore, when I heard the little girl say “We shouldn’t get too close to the pigs because they’re gonna turn into bacon” it devastated me. The love is there we are born with that love but sometimes the indifference or the normality of “that’s how it is, that’s how it’ll always be” is exactly the reason why we are in the Climate Crisis. Those farmers felt like they were doing the right thing, they believed livestock has no carbon footprint. They had little to no idea that they were part of the problem, or maybe they did know but chose to ignore it. Personally I knew that the meat and dairy industries were devastating to the environment but I had no idea that they emitted even more greenhouse gases than the transportation industry. It is clear to me that the food industries have bought out most if not all of these "environmental conservationist" organizations. At the very least the meat and dairy industries are one of the most influential companies in the world and have ties and connections everywhere. It shocked me that the only things we are taught since childhood is to recycle, use solar panels, save electricity but never once were we taught that our diet was the most significant part of our carbon footprint. We could have been saving 1100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 sq ft forest land, 10 pounds of CO2 and one animal’s life everyday by consuming a vegan diet. I wish the government and large campaigning companies would bring this awareness to the public so that we can all reform our lives.

I was also very furious when watching cowspiracy. I could not believe these countries who I thought cared about the environment proceeded to ignore the NUMBER ONE issue of agriculture. I agree the fact that he laughed at the huge issues was horrible to watch, I could not believe it. I agree that it is crazy that an educated compassionate environmentalist chooses to ignore this. I agree it was really sad seeing the family on the farm with all of the animals. That they were so close to them and wanted to be friends with them but knew they would be gone soon. Another thing I thought was interesting about this was when they knew the characters of the animals. I agree about the agriculture industry, I had no idea its carbon footprint was so huge. I have known for a while that one burger is equivalent to a large amount of water, but I did not know the extent till this film. That agriculture is 30% of all water consumption was shocking. Along with this I did not know the power of the meat industries until watching this film. I agree we were taught to recycle and use new light bulbs but never about our eating habits. I think we should have been taught to save 1100 gallons of water and 10 lbs of CO2 for consuming animal products. This is how the education system needs to be redone so that society can learn what is causing the bigger issues.

Cowspiracy is a film which discussed about the negative impact of livestock on the environment. The director used his own experience, plentiful interviews with environmentalists and environmental organizations, and huge data collection to completely reveal the serious conspiracy behind the livestock industry. Though a little data is wrong, it gave the audiences a shock and would make people pay more attention into this topic. When most environmental organizations closed their mouth to not violate the profit of the livestock industry, “environmentalists” become a joke. I was sad that the organizations which lead people to protect the Earth do not do the correct things, but we still need to face the terrible situation and must do some changes. Although it is hard for me to immediately become a vegetarian, I would eat less and keep paying attention to this topic.

                        <br><br>

This film mainly changed my two ideas, the idea about the way to protect environment and the concept of vegetarian. When we think about the causes of environmental pollution, we mainly put our eyesight on the transportation, coal mining, and industrial emissions, which are also the factors told by these environmental organizations. But the truth is that about 15% (not 50% in the film) carbon dioxide emission is from the livestock and their untreated waste. Besides, the livestock industry occupied about 45% land, which once is the place for the rainforest, to graze the livestock. The loss of land resources makes the Earth more vulnerable. Additionally, once I thought why people became vegetarians were because of their own religion or personal health, but now I find that most people become vegetarian are not only because of these factors, but also the best way to protect the environment. After watching this film, I feel a bit pessimistic because the government, the environmental organizations keep silent about the truth of the livestock. They even tried to shut other people’s mouth. The ethos is pretty hard to change, the only part we can change is ourselves.

I think the same way that some cultures value having many children, American's value eating meat. It's part of our culture and agriculture, especially in the Central Valley where I grew up, is a huge thing as well. The climate crisis can not be fixed overnight, but asking people who really don't know anything about the issue, nor do they really care to learn, to adjust their entire lifestyle will turn people off even more. I think that taking the approach that we can do a couple simple things and that will make a huge impact will spiral into something much more effective in the long run. 
                        <br><br>
The false statistic and the badgering of these organizations that went on in the film really disappointed me as far as trying to make a change. The message that this video was trying to send, while valid and good, was poorly executed and came off as a bit aggressive to me. Animal agriculture is harming the environment, but so are most things that we do. We all need to start somewhere and if someone wants to start with diet, then that is great, but for others, this is also their livelihood and they will not be so eager to push a vegan diet on to people. I think that is more practical to argue that we should be showering for less time, or that we shouldn't water our lawns is much less controversial and people will be much more receptive to doing so. Especially when we live in a country that is divided about whether there is even a climate change problem in the first place. The interviewee that stated that people were being killed as a result of speaking out against this issue showed me that if we need instantaneous change if we need radical change, and we need it to happen now, we need to be okay with putting this issue on the backburner and focusing on the hundreds of other ways to reverse the damage that we have done to the earth to get as many people to understand the issue as possible. I think it's really easy for us all to say we want radical change and we need to implicate all of these things into our lives because we all agree with each other because we're all in this class. We need to think about the big picture at the rest of the world, or even the rest of the country, who doesn't see things the way that we do.

Cowspiracy: The film was effective at communicating its subject because it used logos, ethos, and pathos. Logos included the fact that every day, being vegan saves 1100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 square feet of forest, 10 pounds of CO2, and one animal’s life. This highlights that it really is possible for an individual to make a difference. Ethos included when the filmmakers conveyed that they were putting themselves at risk in order to make this film and spread their ideas. This shows their passion and commitment to the environment. Their pathos appeal is apparent when they show the innocent animals in poor conditions and the duck’s head being chopped off. This causes the audience to feel guilty about eating meat and using animal products, and might persuade them to change their lifestyle.
                        <br><br>

Taking all this into account, I do think that Cowspiracy has some flaws in over exaggerating the figures. As Ken mentioned, the Food Agriculture Organization has stated that only about 15% of the greenhouse gases come from animal agriculture, while Cowspiracy says 51%. There is a large discrepancy in these numbers and I definitely think that it undercuts the film. The Cowspiracy website partially addresses this and says "Regardless of whether animal agriculture is responsible for 14.5% of GHGs or 51%, it is still a primary driver of climate change". This is true, but if the validity of the film is put into question, then less and less people will trust any of the information in the film. Thus, many are able to write off Cowspiracy as inaccurate and continue their unsustainable lifestyles.

I completely agree with you that the discrepancy between the 15% and 51% statistics significantly reduces the credibility of the film. Although for me, my overall opinion of the film was not changed because of this difference in percentages, over-exaggerating the impact of animal agriculture in order to achieve the film’s political goal likely does more harm than good. Just a couple weeks ago we studied how think tanks and lobbyists discredit environmentalists using a variety of tactics, including exposing discrepancies in previous research to discredit broad scientific concepts and theories. For instance, people have used Al Gore’s previous predictions regarding climate change to show how alarmists over-stated the extent of the climate crisis in order to gain support for political action. It is a poor strategic choice to open yourself up to such an easy attack on the credibility of the film and its contents. Even though I am sure that much of the information in the film is completely accurate, once there is a single, blatant misrepresentation of the truth the focus shifts to the lie instead of what is true. For instance, part of this lecture focused on the discrepancy, which shows how easily such a seemingly small thing can become a dominant narrative. I am no more likely to cut meat out of my diet because the amount of GHG emissions is 51% as opposed to 15%. However, I am definitely more inclined to dismiss parts of the film as misleading or exaggerated if I know they have already misrepresented statistics.

I have been wanting to watch “Cowspiracy'' for quite some time now, but hadn’t because of the known controversy and shaky facts given. However aside from their incorrect claim of what percent of greenhouse gases is from animal agriculture, the documentary brings awareness to very important topics. Regardless of what the number is, animal agriculture is causing serious harm to our environment, due to methane release, excessive grazing, and massive water consumption, and because this film addresses that and more, I can happily ignore the incorrect claim and appreciate the documentary.
                        <br><br>

I cut beef out of my diet a while ago for environmental reasons as I knew it was one of the simplest, yet biggest ways to reduce my personal carbon footprint. The extent of my knowledge on cattle affecting the environment was basically “cow farts are bad” due to the methane released (and the documentary does say that methane gas is 86 times more destructive than CO2 from vehicles). But what I didn’t realize or focus on was how much water and land is required for all of these cattle. The crazy number of 70 billion cows on this planet of course would take up a lot of water and land, but one individual cow needs so much more than you would think. “One hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to produce” - I cannot even comprehend that claim. We hear about the rainforests being cut down for grazing, but I cannot wrap my head around the amount of water that too is being wasted in this way. Knowing that a regular diet requires 18 times more land than a vegan diet also makes me feel even more guilty about all of the trees and land destroyed for the food industry.
                        <br><br>

Like I said before, I cut out beef for environmental reasons, but did not feel the need to completely avoid animal products knowing beef is the majority of the issue. After watching this, it makes me want to go vegan not for environmental reasons, but for ethical ones. I had to literally cover my eyes during the duck slaughter scene because it made me so uncomfortable. This quote about killing the animal resonated the most with me - “if i can’t do it I don’t want someone else doing it for me.” I can’t even watch a video of it, let alone do it myself, so why am I okay with supporting someone else doing it? The animals we eat are being killed so we can eat them and even animals we don’t eat, like coyotes, wolves, etc. are being killed by ranching to clear the way for the cattle. This documentary truly made me reconsider my dietary choices for ethical reasons, but if I can help the environment in the same way, then I am sold - and of course I will make a larger effort to avoid food waste like Ken suggested while I'm at it.

I’m in a very similar boat that you’re in. I don’t really care what somebody’s opinion is, as long as it is supported by facts that have merit, I’m always willing to listen. That’s why I had avoided seeing this film until now, and I have to agree with you that that number being butchered is only a small speck on an overall powerful message that the film is trying to send.

First off, I have to say that I truly respect your ability to be able to cut beef from your diet. Knowing that doing so makes a massive impact on one’s carbon footprint has led me to limit my beef consumption, but I haven’t been successful in completely removing it from my diet. I agree that this film was very powerful and graphic which may actually help me change my stance on using animals for my diet. Like you, I am definitely reconsidering all of my decisions when it comes to what food I eat and don’t eat, and hopefully this film did the same for many other people as well.

I want to start off by saying that your comment on this movie is really well written. Your incorporation of facts from the film in conjunction with your own personal lifestyle choices and personal experience makes for a very convincing argument. I too have been struggling with the concept of a plant-based diet as I also harbor ethical and environmental concerns in this particular area. As you stated, the effect of methane is often what people focus on when they tend to talk about this issue. I find this to be problematic because 1) it is only a portion of the issue taken out of context and not the whole conflict and 2) "cow farts are bad" can sound pretty ridiculous when all the facts are not considered (86 times more destructive than CO2 from vehicles is much more descriptive). Water consumption is a very prominent part of the meat problem in this country today, especially when water is becoming a more precious commodity worldwide due to (shocker) climate change-induced drought. To add to your point about this aspect, I would like to call attention to a statistic from Ken's prezi: a vegan diet consumes about 300 gallons of water per day whereas a meat oriented diet consumes around 4000 gallons of water a day. Thus a meat oriented diet consumes more than 13 times more water than a vegan diet. This is an astronomical difference, especially when one considers that the average american uses 80-100 gallons of water a day in their home for things such as washing dishes, laundry, etc. When considered exclusively within the scope of water conservation, switching from a meat oriented diet to a vegan diet will have more than 40 times the environmental impact of any changes you may make to your water consumption in your home. This is without considering the impact of methane emissions, land use, and transportation emissions and cost. Additionally (due to facts previously stated regarding land use, water consumption, etc.), the production of meat curtails our ability to produce mass quantities of food (Diet for a Small Planet). Thus, the mass production of meat in the United States has catastrophic environmental consequences as well as a number of humanitarian consequences.

"If I can't do it, I don't want someone else doing it for me" was the most striking part of the entire documentary for me as well. I couldn't bring myself to watch the duck slaughter scene, and I started to wonder why I even ate meat if I couldn't sit through the act of someone else killing the animal it came from. Needless to say, I need to take a serious look at my diet. I feel like as a college student, however, it is very hard to go completely vegan, as the documentary pushes us all to do. It's an expensive lifestyle, eating only plant-based foods, and with little to no income, I don't see this being an option for me. That being said, I do want to make changes to my diet to combat the detrimental effects of the animal agriculture industry.
                        <br><br>


I was completely shocked by the 50% projection about greenhouse gas emissions, but when watching this video, I was relieved but also kind of mad. Real facts are important in changing the tide to get more people on board with environmental activism, and I feel like the over-projected facts only stand to discredit the movement. I understand that the urgency is still there, and the problem does still needs to be addressed, but even in my recommended videos as I'm typing this comment is a video titled "Cowspiracy is Bull". I feel like this misinformation is enough to make people focus on the fact that there are exaggerated claims, rather than the real issue at stake. Maybe that's the reason no one is talking about it? And that people were disagreeing with him in the documentary?

                        <br><br>

I, too, didn't realize the amount of land/water that cattle actually need. It is ridiculous to house that many cows per person, at the environmental cost. As the farmer stated in the documentary "If they don't have the land for it, they shouldn't be eating beef." I feel as though the comment as a little hypocritical on his part, as we, truly, do not have the capacity to be eating as much beef as we currently do. I think it is up to us to start the change and ultimately "herd" the cattle industry into downsizing their production.




<br><hr>

I can relate to a lot of the points you've made in your comment. I have been wanting to watch this documentary as well but I haven't watched it for a different reason. I thought it was going to be this super gorey documentary showing us inside cattle ranching factories and all the really gross stuff that goes on behind closed doors. I was very much surprised by the fact that the bulk of the movie was nowhere near what I had thought. I had to close my eyes too when the duck was being killed. I thought it was interesting that the man said he felt connections to the animals that his family raised as a kid but were then slaughtered. He seemed so sad about losing them but he was doing the exact same thing in front of his daughter. I guess it must be better than industrial animal raising, but it's still sad to watch. 
                        <br><br>


I cut beef out of my diet as well, but more recently. I've talked about this video a couple times in my comments but my change is mostly due to a video called "The Meatrix" that I was shown in Soc 1 during my first quarter at UCSB. It was an animated short but made the situation seem so real and unappealing, which is what I thought this documentary was going to be like. I appreciate the message that was given in this documentary and I think I can also look past the mixed up numbers to see the big picture. Big environmental groups, whose main goal is literally to save the planet, are not acknowledging cattle ranching as one of the biggest causes of climate change. I knew this fact from my AP Environmental Science(APES) class but burning of fossil fuels was definitely taught to be the bigger issue. I'm glad that in this course we are given solutions to the problem at hand rather than just being told how bad it is and how much time we have. I feel really lucky to have been in APES and this class because I continually stop and think about the people of our country who don't get this opportunity and have no idea how big of an affect their diet has on the planet. I want to do my part as well and I hope that we can gradually get more and more people to do the same.



<br><hr>

I totally agree that over-projected facts are discrediting the movement. The creators of the documentary probably used the 51% claim in order to get more people to believe this was a serious and urgent issue. However even with it only being 15%, it still is a serious and urgent issue, but the credibility of the entire documentary was put at risk. The film would have been much more accepted and effective if all of the information was valid. Because we are already facing so many climate change skeptics, them finding out the facts were stretched, making them lies, is hurting our cause instead of helping. I wish that that incorrect claim was not mentioned at all, because then more people would be able to clearly hear the message they were trying to get across instead of focussing on the lie. Just because we may be able to look past the falsity and see the greater importance of the film in no way means that climate change skeptics will do the same. They can discredit one claim and suddenly the entire film is wasted.
<br><hr>

I had similar reactions to the film as you presented. I was shocked to learn that one of the guiding statistics the filmmaker used was incorrect in a pretty glaring way. However, I do agree with you that this doesn’t change the main message of the film. I believe the important part of this is that when the statistic presented to the leaders of impressive environmental organizations, they truly had no idea if this statistic was correct or not as they had not even been validating or considering the issue altogether. The falsehood of the number did not affect the complete ignorance of a subject that is arguably negatively affecting our earth. 
                        <br><br>
I had a similar experience to you as I watched this documentary right before I went to the dining hall for lunch. I felt sick to my stomach and without even noticing it I ate a completely vegan meal. This film deeply disturbed me and has really made me question and want to take action on my eating habits. The quote that one of the speakers in the film said that you simply can’t be an environmentalist and eat meat really hit me. To be immersed in the facts and science and humanitarian ways that something is harmful for our earth, and then continuing to subscribe to this practice seems like a lazy betrayal of my values. I also think your point about wanting to be vegan for ethical reasons rather than environmental was an important one, as I think it vital to realize that these lifestyle changes have meaning and importance beyond just how it affects our emissions. This issue of the meat industry is also terrible beyond its environmental effects thanks to the disgusting, unethical treatment of living beings. These issues are intertwined and both valid, and it is important to see how they exist in tandem. We must be environmentalists and humanitarians. 
                        <br><br>
One part of the film that really struck me was the story of sister Dorothy Strong. The filmmaker asks this woman why people are not speaking out and I don't think he was expecting the powerful response this woman provided. It is important to be cognizant that everyone is not as privileged with free speech as political or activist stances can spark a response of violence. The fact that this woman spoke out about an issue that was hurting our earth and she was murdered is so deeply tragic. This issue of the toxic meat industry and the ways in which it is unsustainable, un-humane, and deeply detrimental literally takes lives. Lives of animals and humans and the fact that another life was taken in reaction to uncovering these truths is so upsetting.

After watching "Wasted" I was fascinated by all the ways that people have been innovative in preventing food waste. It gave me some hope that with more people like these, we can expand this so that all over the world, there is not one piece of food wasted. It was a shocking statistic to me that in the U.S. 70% of the grain is used to feed livestock and not people. All of this food surplus that could be used to feed the large starving population of people is instead used to feed livestock-which is also meant to feed people(but at a much lower surplus). That is why I found so interesting the initiative some brands have taken such as in Japan to recycle wasted food back into livestock feed instead of giving them. I was also startled at how consumerism and marketing play a role in the food we consume. For instance, the fact that lobster was once served in prison and seen as cheap low-quality food, but over time developed into a fine delicacy reserved for the middle and high classes. People used to refuse to eat some foods at one point and then the next second they are paying an obscenely high cost to eat it. It just shows at the unhealthy and irresponsible way we look at food, it's seen more like a luxury and commodity than something we need to survive. So much perfectly edible food is wasted in restaurants and supermarkets just because it doesn't look nice. That's why I found it warming to see the Toast Ale company as an example of how no food should be left to waste. Also, I didn't realize how many people throw away the end slices of bread- yes my family has always left it for last, but we always ate it. As someone who loves eating bread with a passion, it was nice knowing that it is not just being thrown away. I also loved the way the Italians didn't waste bread by turning into a pasta broth, something that could be used to mass feed people with food insecurities. It is devastating and frustrating to know how much food is being wasted when there is so much food insecurity around the world, but innovators like the ones we see in the film make me hopeful that collectively we can make a change both to help the environment and end starvation.

Similarly to you, "Wasted" really resonated with me due to that inspiring theme of individual people all over the world working towards this goal of food without wastefulness. I think that a film like this was really needed following the first five weeks because most of those films focused on the issue itself without providing a good set of solutions or movements fighting against said issue. I felt that the message included in this film about needing a culture shift in order to survive was important to know. Unfortunately, due to the provided options and from what I've seen in the comments so far, most people did not watch this film, instead opting for "Cowspiracy" which in my opinion was a weaker film. "Cowspiracy" mainly focused on a plant based diet as the solution to the problem of environmental waste and sustainability. However, a lot of the arguments in that film were based upon ethics or delusion and in turn was very off putting. Whereas in "Wasted," the focus was towards alternative ways to approach the way we handle food currently. It didn't disregard the meat industry, but rather applied that process of reuse, reduce, and recycle to not only human eating habits, but also the livestock industry. I felt that many of the anecdotes resonated very closely to how many people approach food, especially the segment on sliced bread as you elaborated upon.

Cowspiracy is able to deliver its message so effectively in that it conveys some dramatized emotions that keep viewers at the edge of their seat as the narrator reveals the truth behind what these huge environmental organizations are hiding. The use of all the great visuals and graph comparisons are great as well as they are super effective in showing the stats on just how harmful animal consumption is towards our problem. The best part of this documentary in capturing and communicating the subject was catching the documented response of these high up officials like the deputy executive director and other government figures, and showing their raw responses. These raw responses were filmed so well, that they make such a strong emotional impact in showing how closed up they are about this topic, and how little they know, plus how much they want to cover up their footsteps for their motives. This film is great especially in that it shows the perspective of these high up officials trying to cover up the issue, farmers who raise these livestock, and also that of other environmentalists that actually acknowledge and are open to the problems.
                        <br><br>

I learned a lot of new things from this film, especially about how censored the government and other environmental organizations are about this topic. The film changed my attitude towards livestock raising a bit, but more so made me question ethics even more. After watching the film, I felt much more pessimistic actually, seeing the nature of the situation and the dilemma of this all. When the government officials refused to speak and seemed so dumbfounded, and the director responding so poorly and carelessly about the livestock situation, I felt quite disappointed. The film does a really good job of making it super awkward in the interview when confronting them about the negative effects of animal agriculture, having an inability to talk about the issue. This made me realize how much of a business move this is. Like the film explains, I learned how many of these environmental groups are really just strict membership organizations that want to keep their reliable source of funding and maximize the number of people making contributions and avoiding to get identified as anything controversial. This is slightly saddening.

The message of Cowspiracy was nothing new to me, as I have learned about this topic in many classes. I think we all know that large scale agriculture, especially animal agriculture is not good for the planet. However, meat is just too prevalent in the American diet for people to get off it. I personally rarely ever eat red meat anymore, but I still crave meat in my diet. I've switched to primarily turkey. I know this is still meat and it is destructive to the environment but I think it is more realistic to ask people to switch to different, less resource intensive meats than to ask them to abandon meat altogether. Many vegans and other food activists are too extreme or combative in their dialogue which discourages people from making a shift. If you show people that there are meat options that are less environmentally destructive, they are more likely to make a switch or at least try it out.

Cowspiracy is certainly an eye-opening film regarding the deepest and darkest parts of the environmental organizations. Before watching this film, I thought these orgs are fighting for everything that leads to climate change, but after this documentary, I was introduced to the business side of these so called “NGOs”. In this world of capitalism and materialism, everything is profit driven, and this even include organizations that are fighting against capitalism. Without money, they cannot initiate projects nor buy equipment that can spread their influences. But due to these types of business factors, it would simply be more ethical for these environmental groups to disband and go do something else. Rather than keeping its members in a mist of lies, it would be much better if these people could provide the public with the truth about animal agriculture. As I get older, the reality of this so called: “cruel society” solidifies, I begin to realize that nothing is fair, and everyone is striving for “material high”. To be honest I do not think these types of ideologies could bring mankind further but rather it would destroy us.

I found it astounding that none of the environmental groups mentioned anything about the agricultural business, and when asked, made really weird and elaborate answers that...didn't even hit close to answering the question. It made me think of how the Koch brothers are highly villainized. Everything that pops up, the Koch brothers are at fault. But that's all to do with the oil business, a business that didn't begin until mid 19th century. There are also replacements for things that require oil, such as electric cars, making oil somewhat avoidable (to a minor extent) if you're privileged enough. None of this applies to the cattle industry. Cattle farming has been around for nearly 10,500 years. It is so deeply embedded in who and what humans are. A lot of American ideals even are centered around the concept. The cowboy. The wholesome ranchers and family life. Who wants to villainize that? And the large-scale cattle business, hiding behind the curtain of purposeful societal ignorance, goes unnoticed. Not even unnoticed, just gets a pass. Gets a pass so large that people kill others trying to defend the business as seen by the 1,100 dead Brazilian activists in the past 20 years. We as a people are fine with making oil the bad guy. No doubt, it is a bad guy. But it's not the only one nor the biggest contributor to our environmental problems. Cattle farming is much too old, too engrained into nearly every society, and has no easy, undetectable replacement (I'm sorry but soy "beef" does NOT taste the same and you cannot argue this). For those reasons, cattle farming likely won't end, or even significantly decline and that's really worrisome.

While it comes as little to no surprise that representatives of pro-livestock or farming organizations wouldn't discuss or even mentioning the adverse effects of animal agriculture when interviewed, it was both confusing and disheartening to see that those in administrative positions in environmentalist groups were unwilling to talk about or simply ignorant to the fact that production of meat plays a significant role in greenhouse gas emissions. Really makes one second guess the integrity of the non-profit organizations that are ostensibly doing all that they can to make Earth a more sustainable and inhabitable place. I'm glad Ken noted that the filmmaker made some errors when citing evidence to support his claims that animal production is the leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions. Sounded like a ridiculous statistic when I heard it in the film so I'm glad my skepticism wasn't unfounded.

-       I thought this documentary was extremely interesting in the way that people didn’t want to admit that the beef industry is producing insane amounts CO2 emissions. I think most vegans are concerned with animal cruelty (which indeed is important) but don’t realize that there are way more detrimental effects of the beef industry. People definitely need to get behind this cause if we want to make a difference in our CO2 emissions sooner rather than later but I genuinely think that stopping meat eating just will not happen form most people so the industry will still function and profit and emit methane. 
                        <br><br>
-       Everyone needs to realize that BEEF IS BAD!!!!

From the beginning of the documentary I am hit with a bunch of facts about how bad it is for us to consume meat because cattle is a huge contributor to carbon emissions. In the documentary they talk about how much water a single cow drinks in order to produce milk or meat. A few facts that stood out to me was that it takes 1000 gallons of water to produce a single gallon of milk, it takes 660 gallons of water to make a quarter pound burger from Mcdonalds and it takes 2500 gallons to produce a pound of beef. This is crazy to think about. Our livestock  need so much water that they use ⅓ of all our fresh water in the world. Later in the documentary they state that for every pound of fish we bi-kill five pounds of sealife. Later he continues this fact by saying that we should stop fishing if we care about sea life so we don’t kill that extra five pounds. That is not the problem, the problem is that they don’t return the other sea life back into the ocean. I started to question the documentary because it just seemed like they were using this documentary as a way to scare people into switching to a vegan lifestyle. In Ken’s lecture he mentions that this documentary was using false facts and I want to know what was true and what wasn’t. I think that we should just stick to finishing the food that we buy so it doesn’t go to waste because this is a huge part why we have a huge carbon footprint as people.

After watching it, I think that Cowspiracy is a very good film that I intend to recommend to a lot of my friends and family. Although the filmmakers were wrong in their statistics regarding the actual contribution of animal agriculture on rising greenhouse gas emissions, I think that the movie is invaluable because it reveals some of the fundamental problems of our highly meat oriented society. It is not only the negative effects of livestock agriculture on the environment that is important to highlight, but how wasteless it is. The film throws out a lot of numbers and interviews a number of experts in various fields, but the most memorable quote to me was when one man stated how we could feed every person in the world today a sufficient amount of food if we used all the food we currently eat in addition to all the food that are eaten by livestock animals. The fact that there are hundreds of millions in poverty who go hungry on a regular basis and we make food that could be going to them but give them to animals so we can eat them later, is wrong. Not only is it wrong it is also so unsustainable 

                        <br><br>

Unfortunately, meat has become a foundational part of American culture. A common description of our Independence Day, July 4th, includes grilling burgers and hot dogs. It is hard to take something away from people who have been accustomed to it their entire lives, and I can say because I am one of those meat eaters. I think it is important to slowly reduce your meat consumption, and it is something that I am trying to do currently. I can’t say if I will ever stop eating meat, but even just taking beef out of my diet, even only having it on very special occasions, will reduce my impact as I start to incorporate more elements of a plant-based diet in my life. My hope is that when I am older I can introduce a much more sustainable and efficient diet to my kids that they can continue on in their lives with.

I agree with you. The food we waste, and the food we raise for livestock, can reduce the number of hungry people around the world significantly. Unfortunately, few people realize this.
                        <br><br>
After watching this documentary, I'm glad that UCSB has some programs that advocate vegetarianism. Just yesterday, Carrillo’s Green Day impressed me. There was no meat for a whole day except for the eggs in breakfast. And the most shocking part was that even the tuna in the salad was removed. If schools all over the country can promote similar activities like Greenday, the idea of changing to a plant-based diet will be easily accepted and I believe the world will be better under our efforts in the future.


<br><hr>
I completely agree! What you said about the statistics regarding contribution to agriculture on GHG emissions stuck out to me too. I don't think it's bad to eat meat either, as long as your not eating it daily or buying it from unsustainable sources. I find it really cool how UCSB does Green Mondays because it stops meat-eating campus-wide for a day, which surprisingly does make a significant difference given how many people there are at UCSB. If only we could do Green Mondays more often.

Cows require 20 tons of food PER WEEK. Land that could be used for growing food for people who are suffering from food insecurities is used for livestock. This is just mind boggling to me that feeding cows is a priority over people struggling. Then again, I am not surprised because of how involved the meat industry is with the government. From the local level to congress, the meat industry practically rules the world. If a person causes a disruption in profits of the animal industry you are guilty under the patriot act. One author quite literally warned the producer of Cowspiracy of how dangerous it was for what he was doing. It is simple, the meat industry uses fear tactics and money to get what they want.

                        <br><br>

I found two things quite shocking. First, the meat industry taxes everyone whether they are eating meat or not. These costs are hidden in health care bills, environmental damage, damage to fisheries, etc.. If the meat industry had to bear those costs themselves, all products would skyrocket in price. Second, I am completely thrown off by GreenPeace and other environmental organizations. When I considered the fact that Animal Agriculture Alliance donates to GreenPeace, I felt deceived. An organization that I thought was good and promoted themselves as environmentalists are not. The irony is that environmental orgs are sitting quietly. Like I said previously, food is fed to livestock and not to starving people. There are 70 billion farm animals to 7 billion people and those farm animals cannot sustain the entire world population since we are running out of land. 
                        <br><br>


I didn’t realize that Kip got his facts wrong. Though unfortunate and it may target his credibility, I do think that the documentary tugs on the heart strings. I have heard from many people that Cowspiracy made them consider moving towards a plant based diet. However, as Ken mentions, moving to a plant based diet is good, but wasting less food is better. I have heard the term freeganism before and as a vegan I am quite on board with it. There are even apps that coordinate with restaurants which I think is incredible. What we need to be doing is spreading this information around since everyone is using smartphones these days.

"Wasted! The Story of Food Waste" is an alarming documentary because it shows the many issues that can stem from one problem. In this scenario, it is the mass amounts of food we waste, at the various stages and for different reasons. This can be seen in wasted money, time, labor, electricity, transportation, etc., which is not worth throwing away food to landfill when we know there are other options. The documentary cited giving food to animals to eat as the next best option to humans eating the food we produce. Also on the list is using food waste for electricity or composting it to put it back into the earth. It is interesting to note that the problem of global hunger is not a matter of not enough food produced, but more so stems from the larger system of distribution, storage, and other culturally derived factors. There is hope, though, through the stories that people tell in their pursuit of sustainable farming and cooking, such as making beer out of rejected bread, or using all of a plant to reduce food waste in landfills. This movie also highlighted some of the difficulties people face when they live in food deserts: areas that do not have close and easy access to fresh and nutritious food. We see a family that grew up with only fast-food restaurants or corner stores that sold “convenient” food, with no option to shop at a grocery store. Fortunately, a store opens up that sells healthy food at comparable prices, even buying rejected or unused food from other stores, further helping reduce food waste. 

                        <br><br>

Global issues require the awareness and attention of those contributing to it across the planet. One example highlighted by this film was the wastefulness of the fishing industry as there are large numbers of bycatch associated with trawling, a style of fishing that uses a big net to scrape and grab everything from the ocean floor upwards. Fortunately, chefs everywhere are trying to use the undesired or “trash” fish to minimize the waste that comes from fishers. What was interesting to note was that lobster, uni, and Chilean sea bass were all rebranded to fit into popular and high-class culture, making labels meaningless but also very significant. I think there needs to be more awareness about the pressures we are putting on fisheries, especially since so many people rely on fish as a staple protein in their diet.

I too enjoyed how Wasted focused on one main problem and the solutions that can go along with it as well as how food wasted can become an even bigger problem when not dealt with properly. I was extremely shocked however, when I found out how much Americans actually waste when discussing grocery stores or restaurants. These so called "sell by dates" are just an excuse to keep product moving but perfectly good food is going to waste that could be feeding people who are actually hungry. The example of how the French chef took his own food waste from his world wide renowned restaurant, and used it to prepare meals for the needy was a perfect example of how we should be dealing with our food waste. Not only is he saving perfectly good food from his restaurant but he saves food from local markets that are considered "expired and makes amazing meals with the food they receieve. France and Italy have recently passed similar laws that I personally think America should incorporate into our own system, which state that food from markets can't be discarded at the rate they once were. Since America is one of the most wasteful countries, we should look at our own laws and figure something new out that we could do with our enormous food waste. We've seen many examples in this documentary such as using food scraps and creating energy in a closed loop system or by feeding it to livestock that in turn creates even better food. These are just a few examples of what innovation can do when people become desperate enough. 
 <br><br>
 But I think throughout this whole film I was most shocked by the fact that most of what American farmers grow gets discarded because of its appearance or because it's not up to the grocery stores standards. This is actually crazy because it's the same product but it just doesn't look "pretty" enough.... We're wasting completely good food because we don't like its apperance.  No wonder our country thinks it's okay to throw so much away. Even though I am frustrated with our wastefulness, I am hopeful because they are many things we can do to reduce our food waste and they all seem relatively easy, we just need to start somewhere.

The film “Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret” presents me numerous statistics and interviews, arguing for the harm of animal agriculture and the benefits of plant-based diet. One of the filmmakers, Kip Anderson, made great effort to explore this issue and visited plenty of organizations such as Greenpeace, Sierra Club, Surfrider Foundation, Oceana, Rain Forest Action Network, Markegard Family Grass-Fed as well as many diary companies. Many of these groups refused and avoided to talk about how animal agriculture damage our planet. One imposing metaphor is that the filmmakers are putting their neck on the chopping block, and I am so shocked by the fact that over 1100 activists have been killed in the last 20 years in Brazil. It indicates that the cattle industries are doing whatever they can to achieve profits and prevent us to speak for our climate, even by killing people who are telling the truth such as Dorothy Stang. That’s definitely ironic: as ranchers raise more and more cattle, they regard human as cattle too or as subordinate to their profitable industries of livestocks.   
 <br><br>

    As Ken clarifies, animal production actually accounts for about 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions rather than 50% as Kip mentioned, I appreciate Ken’s scientific attitude. Nonetheless, it’s true that livestocks cost huge amount of water and cause destruction of many Amazon areas. Combining Kip and Ken’s discourses, I find it significant for us to switch our diet away from massive meat diet and greatly reduce our food waste. For example, I could choose to have a fruit bowl for the breakfast instead of McDonald’s or Ham Omelet. I also believe that plants contain a lot of nutrition that’s beneficial and necessary for human beings to thrive. This film reconfirms the idea of how we can change our diet habits to change the climate crisis.

I completely agree with you and the film, "Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret," that we must change our diets by eating less or no meat and not giving in to the demand of the livestock industry that encourages their overproduction and puts corrupted dollars into their deep pockets. Everything about these industries is unethical. The way they abuse the animals and destroy other animals' habitats in order to build more farms to raise livestock just to be pumped with hormones and then killed is extremely disturbing to me and should be for all humans who are aware of it. If this is not enough to motivate people to cut meat out of their diets than we are dealing with a bigger problem of ignorance, selfishness, and insensitivity. As someone who once thought I could never become vegetarian and has now been eating meatless for six months, it is far easier than it sounds and makes a huge impact on my personal health and contributes to the global solution for climate change which is a rewarding feeling. It takes everyone's small acts of change to make a large impact.

Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret was a huge eye-opener for me as it really did highlight some important discussions that need to exist when tackling the climate crisis. Not only did it tackle the politics behind climate focused organizations and their inability to provide accurate information, but it also highlighted the true scale of the problem that eating meat/animal products really has. I myself have been vegetarian for my entire life, but not for climate reasons. My parents are from India, and the particular state they are from is all vegetarian, so its all they've ever known until they came to the US. Even after moving here, my mom saw things like McDonalds and other fast food and the effect it had on people, making them lethargic and obese, so we stayed away from it. Therefore, my diet has mostly consisted of things like lentils, rices, vegetables,milk/yogurt, and breads. One thing I found incredibly shocking to me was the amount of resources it took to produce things like milk and yogurt and cheese. I wasn't as shocked of the impact that beef had since I was expecting it to be a lot given that I'd heard some figures from other parts of this class. But milk, yogurt, and cheese on the other hand, was somewhat on par with the resources needed to produce beef. This was crazy to think about since I grew up with the idea that milk is good for your bones and will make you strong, so every kid needs to drink it otherwise we will be weak. In a sense, this definitely applies to everyone who grows up here as well. Since they could remember, beef and other meats were certainly a part of their diets, so to think that leaving all previous knowledge of food behind and switching to vegan or even vegetarian is a sort of culture-shock that most people aren't willing to voluntarily go through. Just as Kip found out in one of his first interviews, even people who run huge climate focused groups dont think that people will take on the idea of switching their diets too lightly, so they focus on smaller, manageable things like shorter showers instead.

I agree! My general reaction to the film wasn't a surprise. I generally already knew this information, and have done multiple projects on agriculture related subjects but its crazy how much food really changes the planet.  I really like your veiw from a cultural point of veiw. One of the main things i think of when trying to switch to vegitarian is the fact that my family is filipino and would greatly judge me when i dont eat meat. It almost makes me feel bad because of their veiw points but i know that eating meat has bigger consequences.

When Ken informed us that animal agriculture accounts for 15% of greenhouse gas emissions rather than the 51% repeatedly stated in the film Cowspiracy, I had a moment of doubt in the message behind the film itself. Of course it is environmentally more sustainable to eat a plant-based diet, but the fact that misinformation made up the basis of the film brings everything else into question. As a casual viewer, had I tried to verify the 51% statistic only to find it false, I would likely have disregarded the movie entirely. But as a person concerned with the impacts of anthropocentric behaviors on the planet, I am willing to take in the big picture. One scene that got my attention was the comparison between diets of a vegan, vegetarian, and the average American. According to those numbers and illustration, it would seem that a global vegan diet really would solve so many problems, but those statistics should be taken with a grain of salt since Kip has already provided the audience with misinformation. One moment that stuck with me was the slaughter of the duck. It got me thinking: if I had to kill an animal every time I wanted to eat meat, I would be completely vegetarian. The reminder of what happens to dairy cows and egg-laying hens when they stop producing was unpleasant, but important to remember. As stated by the dairy farmer in the film, it is all about profitability. Such a statement makes it easy for one to draw the conclusion that our focus on profits leaves little room for compassion, or even basic respect for the creatures with whom we share this planet. This idea is only further supported by the fact that we continue to overfish our oceans with little regard for the negative impact we are making.

When Kip Anderson mentioned the cattle industry is responsible for 51% of the global GHG emission, I was like wait a second that’s different from what I learned during Ken’s class. I started to go back and check my lecture notes and found the data to be very contradictory. The film “Cowspiracy” is not engaging at all. I would say all of the interviews he made in this film ended with embarrassment. Apart from that, I did not expect to see a duck being slaughtered in this film. That scene was just so abrupt and was presented with no reason. We all know that we have to kill animals for meat but filming a duck being beheaded has absolutely nothing to do with helping the environment. I think Kip is being so pessimistic that he cannot stop embarrassing the environmentalists for ignoring animal agriculture. 
 <br><br>


Although his data is wrong and his interviews are amateur, I do feel a lot concerned about what I eat after watching this documentary. The whole time watching this film I couldn’t stop imagining what if I was born as a cow on an industry farm. Spending my first two days with my sweet cow mom, then go into a cage eating all day for about a year then turn into 100 delicious juicy Big Macs. What would I think during my whole “cowlife" besides eating and sleeping?  From my view, every time I consume meat, there is blood on my hands. But I do not feel guilty taking their lives for food. What makes me feel guilty is wasting food especially meat. When they die for a great cause (Big Mac) we cannot just throw them away. We should be more appreciative while eating meat.

It's good and all to feel sorry for animals but I think the human species needs to put itself first. Ironically, the latter actually also involves eating less meat. Yes, it's "sad" to imagine a poor cow's life but in truth what is more tragic (to me) is the human suffering caused by mass-production of meat itself. I have no qualms whatsoever in eating an animal; but if this act involves killing the planet and indirectly participating -- even microscopically -- to the demise of my species, that's when I start thinking and eating less meat. 

 <br><br>


I like your last sentence about appreciation. It's a parallel to minimalism: I'd rather eat 1 excellent steak per month than one average industrial steak per day. Facing the climate crisis doesn't mean we can't truly appreciate things anymore, on the contrary. It's an opportunity to return to a quality-over-quantity mentality.

Well, I think there is definitely a biological reason behind the fact that Animal agriculture has a higher carbon footprint and consumes more water resources than human beings. It is indisputable, as presented in the document Cowspiracy, that agriculture and livestock industry are having a higher carbon footprint 2 to 3 times than the carbon footprint of all human transportation combined. The idea that human is at the top of the ecological food chain could give us an insight into why this is the case. The carbon cycle and the nutrient cycle in nature inscribe that there is a loss of biomass up the food chain. It means moving up from the food chain, only 20% of the nutrient could be absorbed by consumers at a higher level. Therefore, a larger population of cows or other livestock must be kept to feed the human population especially in cultures where meat consumption is favored. 

 <br><br>

However, this is not to say that such environmental destruction as a result of massive animal agriculture is inevitable. Like Kent says in the lecture, "we could choose to live in the future" by having to adopt a sustainable lifestyle and consume significantly less meat. It is ironic that although people value physical health more, they intend to consume more animal products which are now considered less healthy than plant-based diets. While consider shifting to a vegetarian diet from years-long meat consumption, the process must be gradual and honestly hard to achieve. Even if people are well informed that changing lifestyles could be one of the easiest and most significant ways to combat the climate crises and really make a change for our planet's future, they face obstacles to aptly taking action. So I want to hear how people could change their ways of consumption after a life-time of meat consumption.

Combining the documentary with my own point of view, the reasons for not wasting food are:1. Waste of food will damage the environment: Humans have cultivated a large area of ​​wasteland to grow food. Waste of food will exacerbate this environmentally damaging behavior. Anaerobic decomposition of food produces a large amount of methane, leading to the greenhouse effect. 2. Waste of food will cause some people to go hungry: Of course, it is impossible for us to send every mouthful of food left to the mouths of hungry people, but every time we buy an extra kind of food, there will be less on the global shelf Same circulating goods. 3. Waste of food is a waste of money. So, from a personal perspective, how can we not waste it? 1. Of course, how much you buy and how much you eat, and you eat them all after you buy them. 2. Try to eat at home and buy vegetables from the vegetable market. In this way, you can eat ingredients that are wasted for various "look" reasons. 3. When eating out, pack leftovers and be sure to eat them when you go home. 4. Eat more different types of food, because some foods are wasted if you don’t eat them (such as other fish caught with shrimp) 5. Eat all parts of the plant (rhizomes and leaves) and the animal's internal organs. I think people should face up to their own "eating" and admit that we, as animals, must rely on nutritionally balanced food to survive. Being vegetarian or opposed to eating certain types of meat is more extreme, and not waste is the best choice.

In the lecture, Ken pointed out agriculture is the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases since it’s the leading cause of many environmental problems such as deforestation, water consumption and pollution which are responsible for more greenhouse gases and agriculture is also primary driver to extinction problems. Hence, we need to reduce our waste of food. Ken also corrected that animal production accounts for about 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emission which is still a exaggerating number and he also claims that greenhouse gases leased in producing meat is much more than producing plants. To help reducing greenhouse gas emission, we should eat more plant-based diets. By changing how we eat, we can make a 10 times better effort for the planet than other solution.
 <br><br>
The documentary “Wasted” showed what solutions people or company used to reduce the waste of food to solve one of the greatest problems in the 21st century and it also advocated the plant-based diet. Watching this film, i was surprising to know the exaggerating data about wasting food. For example, 1/3 of all food production is never eaten, 40% food we produced is going to waste. I can’t believe that laboring people work hard to produce food for people, but most of those food are being wasted and those food could have feed many starving people. And also i can’t imagine what a negative impact it will caused to the environment as over 90% of wasted food in U.S. end up in landfills.
 <br><br>
However, it’s admiring that many people are taking actions to reduce food waste. As the winery the film shown, in toast ale, some grains are replaced by wasted bread, and each bottle contains at least one piece of bread. What make me eye-opening it’s how Japan do to reduce waste. I always heard of Japan to be an environmental-friendly country, but i’ve never learned what actions they take. Japan executes the Eco-feed. They bring in food waste, shredding food and heating to kill bacteria so that these waste food can be recycle to lactic acid-fermented food which is probiotic and full of natural vitamin.

I believe the film Cowspiracy was extremely effective at portraying the destructive reality of animal agriculture. Filmmaker Kip Andersen was able to portray this as well as he did by simply reporting the terrifying facts of the agricultural industry and the corporations that run it. I believe this striking film attracts my generation-teenagers and young adults that were born into this environmental crisis and are much more conscious of our impact. We have talked about this extensively in this class. Our generation isn't to blame but we are here to fix. I personally have heard countless times from my peers that the charges in their diet were sparked by this film. It is shocking how complacent our government and people are to our planet and the help it so desperately needs. The agricultural industry is responsible for 15% of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. It is responsible for ocean dead zones, deforestation, water consumption, pollution, etc. This film should spark an intellectual and emotional response in every person it reaches. We should want to do something to change our own and corporate behavior regarding destructive environmental impact. This film makes me conscious of how I can make personal changes to my everyday life and diet. But, it also makes me realize the severity of our detrimental current crisis and how quickly it gets worse every single day. It makes me realize how terribly we have permanently affected our climate. This film isn't about learning new information but seeing all of the truths of the agricultural industry we have learned in this class addressed in one film. The reality of our crisis is anything but optimistic. In the last 10,000 years humans have affected our planet beyond what anyone can imagine and beyond what our government advertises to the public. Everyone should see this film! The importance of lowering the consumption of beef and food waste is detrimental to our planet's crisis.

Cowspiracy did make me bad about eating meat. This class continuously talks about how eating meat is bad for the environment, but I did not really think much of it until I watched cowspiracy, and I saw what really went behind in the meat industry. Cowspiracy taught me how bad animal agriculture really is, I did not know that animal agriculture causes more greenhouse gases than the transportation industry. I definitely did not know that it took that much and more to raise cows for our consumption. Obviously, the best way to fight against this aspect that contributes to the climate crisis would be to become vegan, however I think this is an impossible task. A more approachable way would be to reduce the amount of meat factories there are, or at least find a more environmentally sustainable way to produce meat.

The movie "Cowspiracy" was definitely an eyeopener for a range of reasons. One might not realize, myself included, how harmful the meat industry is for this planet. Usually, when people say that eating cows is bad, we just think that they are animal lovers and often dismiss it, however it is such a larger problem than that. Yes, eating animals can seem pretty horrible in certain aspects, but many meat lovers would not be willing to give up a steak just from that. However if they knew the other effects caused by eating meat that are shown in the movie, perhaps their thoughts would change. The fact that these companies are responsible for such a big part of environment disaster, such as forest degradation, CO2 emission, and animal abuse is just disgusting. They feel no remorse as they are just in for the money and see it is a way of business, but the fact is, it is harming not only the animals at hand, but also hurting other species by tearing down more and more land for these livestock to be grown on and fed on. The land that is used to keep the livestock is basically ruined after these animals graze upon it until they are used for their meat, dairy, or other byproducts for our own benefit. The consumers are usually unaware of the drawbacks created by eating meat, and it definitely made me feel very conscious of how much meat I consume.

<p>
After watching the film “Cowspiracy,” I can’t help but think about some of the facts Kip brought up that continue to stick in my head. As I learn more about the Climate Crisis, I know that switching to a plant-based diet is essential. However, I never knew the real cost of eating a piece of red meat. When Kip said one quarter pounder uses 660 gallons of water, the same as showering for 2 months, I was astonished. I knew cows produced methane but failed to also realize a cow’s resource consumption and need for space (i.e. cutting down the Amazon).
  <br><br>

The second fact that shocked me was about Dorothy Stang and other environmental activists trying to protect the Amazon from cattle grazing and other agricultural related deforestation. It was sickening to know she was shot dead because of the cattle business alone with over 1000 others. The cattle industry is destroying our planet and people, and hearing Dorothy’s story broke my heart.

I was thinking in similar ways, but as Ken stated in his lecture, the documentary maker is just twisting the fact by stating that 51 percent of total carbon produced is because of animal raising. You have to think 15 percent, it is greatly differed from 51 percent. I began to doubt the credibility of his whole film, and I realize that the whole film may not be so credible. As a person who do so much exploration in animal raising, he claimed that our diet is the first initiative and want to find out whether organizations do not want to talk about it. However, why those organizations do not mention it is not because of money power mainly, from my perspective. It is simply because diet is something really hard to change and 15 percent means it is not the "boss" pollutant, dealing with it is just inefficient. The whole film gives me a biased view that everyone is cheated, and make me neglect that the truth as I mentioned above. I mean this film can even have detrimental effects. Through deliberately figure these environmental organizations' directors as driving by money and do not want to talk about environmental issues, the viewers can significantly withdraw their trust in these organizations simply because they are cheated by the filmmaker. The influence is tremendous! I am so angry and cannot help regarding the funds of the film may come from oil industries as a method to withdraw our attention to their industry. It is just unconvincing! I have to admit the film is appealing, but it is twisted so much.


<br><hr>
I too could not believe how much water was used to produce meat, this film definitely made me think a lot more about my consumption and how much  better switching to a plant-based diet is.While Ken does not that the facts were twisted in the documentary, it still made me think about my impact. While there is a problem with the changing facts, I understand why because they were just trying to get people's attention, but I can see how the incorrect facts could make the argument invalid.
<br><hr>
After watching "Cowspiracy," I was also really surprised to learn about how much a quarter-pound burger costs in water. You usually don't think about these things when you go to order some food. Like Kip, I thought I was doing well by taking short showers and using as little water as possible. But one burger can completely undo everything you try to work for.
 <br><br>
It is also devastating that the cows need so much land to live on. We are cutting down and getting rid of organisms that will help save our planet (trees taking in the CO2 in the air) and replacing them with organisms that will drive our planet faster to devastation (methane-producing cows).
 <br><br>
It's so sad that many organizations will not label agriculture as the leading cause of deforestation because it will probably hurt them. Like Dorothy Stang who fought to protect the Amazon from the agriculture industry. It was heartbreaking for me as well to hear about what happened to her when she was fighting for what is right.

<br><hr>
I too was extremely shocked and saddened by hearing the story of Dorothy Stang. To be killed by the cattle farmers/industry for simply speaking out against deforestation and cattle farms is just so senseless and heartbreaking. It’s hard to imagine a more senseless killing. I think it also shows just how important money is to this industry and how much some of them prioritize   profits even over other people’s lives.  
 <br><br>

I also thought it was insane how a quarter pound burger was the equivalent of showering for two months. I would’ve never guessed it was anywhere close to that much water before watching this documentary. It also seems so nonsensical to eat meat, especially red meat, after hearing just how destructive and costly it is to produce. To make the change to a plant based diet will be hard for many of us to do at first but it seems necessary if we are to take climate change seriously and wish to make a difference in a positive way.

I have always been told that the best way to go vegan is to watch documentaries on the meat industries and you will never want to turn back. This was the first documentary I've seen and I was truly left in shock. I feel like every 5 minutes with new more extreme stats coming up, and the way we as the audience got to piece together the information alongside the main character, truly let us build an emotional connection to the cause of this film and understand the level of harm the meat industry has on its animals, and the environment. It was disturbing to see how naive many people were about this polluter, and how they would keep it a secret if they knew for the benefit of business and themselves. I was shocked that this was one of the first documentaries to truly release so much hidden information on the subject matter and felt truly enraged and empowered after watching this film. My heart shattered seeing the close quarters the animals that are slaughtered were in, and the cruel way they were mishandled. I had to close my eyes when the chicken was being slaughtered and then I thought about how I eat chicken meat at least once a week and never truly connected the process of how the chicken gets on my plate to its life and treatment. This film really opened my eyes and inspired me to watch more of these documentaries. Slowly but surely I have been eating more meat free meals and been more cautious in my diet. I feel healthier and happier for it already.

After watching “Cowspiracy” it is obvious money from special interests can subvert every attempt by the people of the united states to do the right thing. more shocking is the corruption and incompetence of these 'green' organizations. I am an avid meat consumer and I don't think I can cut meat completely out of my life and I think most Americans are in the same boat as me and the worst thing about it is now that I am aware of the environmental costs all I can do is eat switch some beef out for vegetables. The suffering these animals go through is horrendous and I feel like a monster after eating a burger, but the alternative is not having a burger (and I mean a good burger not the DLG trash that is served to us). I will try to eat less meat and switch to fish but I don't see myself going longer than a week without meat which is honestly depressing. Can I really be so set in my ways? Maybe this is what addiction feels like?

I greatly agree in your thoughts. I'm also an avid meat consumer, and Ken talking about having to "change our diets" slightly discourages me or even alienates me from being able to make a change. I can't completely remove meat from my diet due to my culture's obsession with meat. The closest thing I could possibly do is to REDUCE the amount I consume, but not COMPLETELY remove it. 
 <br><br>
"Cowspiracy" was a really eye-opening film, showing meat eaters like ourselves the consequences of consuming meat. The only downside of the film is the constant over-exaggeration and false facts that get presented. Things like that doesn't help in promoting awareness. In fact, it impedes it by giving more fuel to the climate-crisis-deniers in their crusade of continuing fossil fuel industries and things alike.

<br><hr>
I understand it can be difficult to cut meat out of your life completely. However, if that is not something you are capable of, perhaps simply consider consuming less meat on a daily basis. Maybe try a Green Monday once in a while, in which you do not eat meat. This can not only be beneficial to your health (as recent studies have linked consumption of animal based products to a higher risk of various types of cancer), but to your wallet as well. Did you know that eating vegetarian at restaurants is significantly cheaper? For example, at Freebirds here, Veggie Nachos are 12$ and come with free guac, however Beef Nachos with guac are around 18$. This is an almost 150% markup compared to the veggie nachos. Please feel free to contact me if you want to discuss this further.

<br><hr>
The way you put it sounds a little depressing, and I'm sorry you have to feel this way every time you consume meat. May I suggest that you just try to become a vegetarian for a week? Having been a vegetarian my whole life, I just don't see why people view meat as such a 'holy grail' when it comes to dietary options. Even at the dining commons, it is perfectly accessible to gain a completely nutritious meal just by eating the vegetarian options. Even in IV restaurants there are vegetarian options which are fulfilling, tasty, and even more cost effectively. Through this process, maybe you can also change your mindset with regards to regarding meat as so important in your life. There are many studies which have showed that living a vegetarian diet is so much better for your health, and I honestly feel as though meat is overhyped in our society today. In my Indian culture, we have sustained ourselves for thousands of years on a culinary culture revolving around vegetarianism. While I understand that you have lived your whole life eating meat, perhaps you might be able to see the benefits of becoming a vegetarian. You say that you are 'set in your ways,' and that may be fueled by the fact that American culture is not adapted for vegetarianism - it is very foreign to them. Therefore, I urge you to try foods from Indian culture where vegetarianism has been a central part of their culture from the beginning, allowing for masterful and complex vegetarian cuisine to evolve.

I was totally surprised by the film “Cowspiracy.” The producers of this film effectively demonstrate the environmental issues. This film mainly express on food wastes and change on food diet. Due to large cultivation of cows, there are many animal extinctions, forest cut down, and even desertification, caused by over consuming grass on the ground. I never thought that cow industries could do so much harm to Earth’s climate change. The amount of methane that the cows produce are crazy. Also, I used to believe that if I eat less meat would be beneficial to Earth’s climate change; however, I forgot that milk is also th by-product of cow industries, and I keep consuming milk for a long times. By now I may know what kind of life style I should live with. This allows the audience to be aware of what the planet is going through and try to make a difference in our lifestyle based on food and the animal agriculture.The film gives a good idea on how we should reflect and meditate on our ideas and what possible actions we can take to improve our conditions .I understand that not everybody is willing to change their habits, but the percentage that does still makes a different to the world.

The film did a really god job in communicating its subject. The subject of cattle raising having tremendous impact in climate changes is mainly manifested with precise data exposed in reputable websites as well as interviews with some of the most respected environmentalists and leaders of large organizations. Some tried hard to hide the truth in order to protect their own interests, while others, mainly retired former workers from those organization, environmental scientist, or even poultry farmers, are willing to expose the truth to the public, and thus call for actions by the majority to reduce animal agriculture such that more crops would be used to feed starving human beings rather than cattle. 
 <br><br>

 Personally speaking, I was aware of the contribution of animal agriculture to the emission of greenhouse gases way before I watched this film, but I did not know that the contribution was so tremendous. I was also surprised to know that even such a large global population can still be fed if we free ourselves from dependence on meat and dairy food. After this film, I altered my attitude toward vegans. I became more respectful to this group of people, because they are actually contributing their power to save the world and save our future. Overall, I felt optimistic about our future, because we can make a difference right away. We can start to behave like a vegetarian and refuse to consume cattle and poultry. However, there is one last thing that makes me upset. I am afraid that giants in animal agriculture would use their political power to intervene in such situation. If they do so, I am worried if we are really capable of fighting against them.

After watching Cowspiracy, I am somewhat dumbfounded. Ken has been giving us figures for the greenhouse gas contributions of the agriculture and specifically livestock industry, but what really bathers me is the unwillingness for environmental agencies to do anything. These organizations are willing to fight fossil fuel corporations and their respective interests in the government, but they are not willing to address a business that is responsible for not only 1/3 of methane, but the direct destruction of so many habitats. Because of this the public cannot adapt their lifestyles since they do not know there is a problem there. I guess this shouldn't surprise me given how powerful corporations are in our economy, but they silence activist by killing them. Not like the fossil fuel industry by discrediting them, but actually killing them. These activists are just a roadblock for them and their solution is violence. I thought we had gotten past this point as a society, but I guess I was wrong. After watching this, I am extremely upset that once again it seems information is just not getting to the places that it needs to. This is just in a different way, fossil fuels use  discrediting, livestock uses fear.

I also found myself in complete disbelief in the lack of awareness that surrounds the livestock industry and just how often environmental agencies ignore the problem. The fact that cows consume so much just so we can turn around and eat them is astonishing, and overall the entire video just baffled me. I knew that the livestock industry was a huge problem, especially after seeing "Before the Flood", but "Cowspiracy" took it to a whole other level. The fact that big players in the Beef Industry are willing to kill to keep their empires alive (Thank God I don't live in Brazil) and how deeply eating beef is ingrained in American culture ( Burgers, Steak, etc..), it makes me wonder if anything will ever change. 
 <br><br>

One realization I found myself coming to during the video was how lame and bothersome it comes off when people find out you're vegetarian. The Beef Industry has such a grip on people's diets that some people actively shame others for being vegetarian. The fact that this obsession with cows runs so deep as to cause social divides is a testament to how determined these corporation are to keep you eating their products, and how far they will go to regardless of the implications.
 <br><br>

Despite me knowing the taxing nature of the Beef Industry, I didn't like that the film inflated certain statistics to emphasize their points. I know that regardless of the statistics that agriculture hurts the environment. However, authenticity is a big deal when it comes to making a documentary and the fact that you had to correct it definitely affects how much I trust the rest of the film.

I thought Kip Anderson's melodramatic and alarmist approach to the issue of animal agriculture was too extreme and therefore ineffective. 
 <br><br>

Most of the time, when we think of human issues causing climate change, we think about cars, fossil fuels, and deforestation -- dirty things that we can clearly see hurting us. We don’t think usually about food and eating, two beautiful things that nourish our bodies. However, food and eating are the most human of human-issues. But it’s not really because of the food and the eating! It’s because of the farms and food corporations who no longer provide us with food to feed us, but provide us with food to feed themselves. They’re doing it for the money, and they don’t care if they destroy our planet in the process. The biggest human issues are really corporate issues. We just don’t completely understand it yet.
 <br><br>

Kip Anderson didn’t seem to understand it either. He looked at Oceana’s website. He said “I was astounded to read they actually recommend that one of the best ways to help fish is to eat fish” but that’s not what Oceana’s website was saying. I paused the screen and actually read the website. They were saying “eat sustainable seafood”. In other words, they were urging people to support sustainable fisheries and essentially drain unsustainable fisheries of their power. Obviously, getting everyone to stop eating fish would help the most. But that's not going to happen. That's impractical. You can't change the food cycle. And Oceana is smart enough to know that. Instead, they’re going to offer feasible and realistic methods of helping oppose unsustainable fisheries and improve animal agriculture so that the environment is less taxed by our needs. Kip Anderson's extreme message of getting everyone to stop eating animal food is not only ineffective but also harmful. If people are told that the only solution is to STOP eating animal products, they're most likely not going to do anything. On the other hand, if they're told that there are more realistic and feasible ways to change their lifestyles such as supporting sustainable agriculture and eating LESS animal products, they're more likely to make a change and help out.
 <br><br>

In the film, farmers Doniga Markegard and her husband were talking about how sustainable agriculture is exactly what “more of society needs to see is that that packaged piece of meat is a living animal.” In a sense, sustainable agriculture can help people eat less meat by allowing them to view animals as animals rather than objects. Doniga says she loves animals and that’s why she’s in the meat industry. Again, Doniga understands that most people are not going to stop eating meat. So instead of trying to change the human diet and the food cycle, which is impossible, we must change the way animals are raised and killed so that the situation is more appropriate and fair to the animal species and to the environment. 
 <br><br>

Energy companies aren’t going to stop extracting fossil fuels, factory farms aren’t going to stop their business, and the agriculture industry isn't going to stop cutting down trees. That is, unless we do something. These are all corporate problems but they don’t have corporate solutions. The solution can only be catalyzed by the people. Think about it: farmers don’t farm to feed us -- they farm to feed themselves. They grow food because they need our money. Therefore they’re going to do whatever it takes to increase their production yield. In other words, they’re going to find methods that allow them to harvest the most food in the shortest amount of time, even if it means using antibiotics, raising more livestock than necessary, producing food waste, and destroying the environment in the process. However, if we boycott unsustainable farms and solely support sustainable farms, farmers will realize they must make a change to the way they run their farms if they want to stay in business.

You have an interesting take on the film and I see where you're coming from. I agree with you that majority of Americans aren't going to stop eating animal products, regardless of how aware they become of the environmental impact this lifestyle is having. However, I don't think it is impossible to change the human diet and the food cycle. As you said, the solution lies within the power of the people. If every person that watched this film made the decision to become vegan, that wouldn't solve the problem - but it would definitely be a step. We have talked a lot in this class about consumerism and how American society has been shaped by advertisements from corporations trying to sell their products. Over time, consumerism has become a staple of American culture, it has become the essence of the American dream. The same thing could happen here with environmentally conscious lifestyle choices like veganism/vegetarianism. It is unrealistic to assume that one person alone could have much of an impact, considering how every day the Amazon is still being cut down for cattle, tons of fish being pulled out of our oceans, and gallons of water still being used for animal agriculture. But if more and more of us begin to adopt plant based diets, there will be a higher demand for plant-based options in restaurants and supermarkets, and eventually vegan options will become trendy and widespread. I am already beginning to see more vegan friendly options, and I think if more and more people adopt these lifestyles, cultural change is definitely possible. It will admittedly be difficult, but I think with the help of policy changes like the Carbon Tax or just more information on the environmental impact our food-choices are having, we will begin to see change. Even if it means just eating less meat and dairy, that alone will have an impact if others in our communities begin to do it as well!

This film was very effective at communicating the subject of animal agriculture. It achieved this by introducing the viewers with the main issue. The film opened my eyes about animal agriculture and how this major industry has tried its best to keep everyone in the dark about how the animal industry is the main reason for deforestation, pollution, global warming, ocean pollution, and much more. The food industry is connected with the government, therefore anyone trying to speak up about this is technically going up against an opponent with many legal resources. This film showed the journey of the documentary and discovered the truth behind everything that was going on.  The film's audience are people that are too scared to speak out about the livestock industry. For people that want to better the world. This film is made for people that are concerned about the issue. In the film, we can see that many main earth organizations are not aware of the number one leading thing polluting our planet and this goes into detail and wants people to be more aware about what they eat. For years we have been kept in the dark about all of this and this film is exposing all of it for us to see just what the government wants to hide from us. My general reaction to this film was that I'm very surprised by this issue. I feel very blind for not seeing this anytime sooner but prior to this film, I had no idea something like this was happening. My response was more towards the intellectual side because I started to think about how the government tries its best to make other issues seem like they are the ones causing all of the global warming, when in reality its cows and the food industry that are impacting our environment in harmful ways.  I learned that all it takes from us humans is to have an open mind about this issue and to try and not support the livestock industry as much. It's the number one reason that we are experiencing global warming and many people are left in the dark not knowing that it's dangling our own environment. This film has made me see a completely new perspective on the food industry. It has made me realize that eating things such as meat, or dairy products are very harmful for the environment and we must try to minimize the consumption. I would definitely recommend this film to a friend that is not sure about the main reason for global warming and climate change. This all ties back to the idea of eating healthier and not consuming meat or dairy products.

“We don’t need to produce more, we need to act different” challenges the very foundation of our economic system. We’re taught that the more we produce as a country, the wealthier we grow, improving our standard of living, but we don’t learn of the waste that comes from our incessant production. This is one of my favorite films because it exposes how much food goes to waste in terms of food at the consumer level, and makes one reflect on our choices. It’s disturbing to me to think of all the food that goes to waste when there are people starving. I think food waste has a lot do with socioeconomic status. I’m poor, so grew up hearing, “throwing food away is a sin,” and never questioned it, but I’m sure someone who grew up in a more wealthy and privileged household may not see a problem with throwing food away. Chef Massimo Bottura explained “hunger meant that everything was extraordinary,” which is so funny to me because if I was being picky about my food my mom would say, “con hambre todo es bueno,” which is literally the spanish translation of what he said. If I said a certain fruit or vegetable “looked ugly” she’d say “If food could speak, what would it say about you?” Kind of harsh, yes, but it was her way to make me understand that food has a value and it’s ridiculous to throw food away bc of how it looks. ITS FOOD.
 <br><br>

In order to fight food waste it’s important to see where the food we eat comes from, but also where the food we don’t eat goes to. My first thought is our very own dining commons. What happens to all the leftover food? Or leftover meal swipes which have already been paid for? Why can’t I use one of my meal swipes for my friend? Simply by allowing students to swipe another person into a dining common would likely prevent a good amount of food from going to waste. The “one fruit/dessert only” policy is ridiculous. What’s going to happen if I take two bananas instead of one? That joke of a policy makes students self-conscious because technically now I’m “stealing” a banana. I’m still going to keep taking more than one fruit, but I shouldn't have to hide it. Changing dining common policies is necessary to combat food waste. If UCSB plans to be the first carbon-neutral UC school, then we can start by not being hypocritical, and ignoring the obvious. It’s only logical that less food will go to waste if you simply let people eat the food.

I also enjoyed this film because it really gives you an accurate depiction of how much food really goes to waste. It does really make you think and contemplate about your own eating habits while there are people starving around the world. I grew up in a cultured household where wasting food is also seen as a sin even to my extended family. When we have family gatherings there is one aunt who makes sure everyone gets what they can eat and not waste any food at all by getting others to finish your plate. She will even go as far as to save all the food and keep them as leftovers during the gathering and give it to her neighbors, friends, etc. I also thought about our own dining commons while watching this. They will have a variety of plates and bowls of food that people have never seen before and will probably try it and not like it and then throw it all away. I am guilty of this but i do not take full responsibility for the dining commons not having small samples you can eat before trying the actual food. I think that should definitely be implemented into every school dining commons.

After watching the documentary “Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret or Wasted! The Story of Food Waste!”, I was so shocked by the fact that raising cows is so harmful to our environment. It consumes a large amount of water and cattle produce methane by their digestion system. The percentage of greenhouse gases emissions from raising cows is extremely exceeding the percentage of greenhouse gases emissions from transportation. Water consumption for raising animals is also huge. These lead to massive destruction for our planet, for example wildfires, flooding, drought, and so on. As human beings, we always think about ourselves, which is kind of selfish. Some animals are suffering from mass extinctions, some people in poor areas of the world are enduring famine, and children who are just come to this world are living in bad environment. They know nothing about the climate crisis, but they suffer the most. However, nowadays, people with high life quality produce a lot of greenhouse gases, which is harmful to the Earth. Maybe to be a complete vegetarian is difficult in a short term, but to waste less food and try to consume plant-rich diet can also be helpful.
 <br><br>
What’s more, overfishing devastated the ocean. Some marine animals even do not have enough time to reproduce. Many animals are nearly extinction, which hurts the healthy level of ecosystem. I found ridiculous that some people claim that it is effective to protect fish by eating fish. The more fish people catch, the more destructive the ocean will be. I thing it is necessary to ban fishing appropriately. We do not need that much amount of fish. A lot of them are wasted. Thus, what we should do in our daily lives is to waste less food.

Likewise, I was shocked about how harmful beef production is to our environment. After knowing this, I started looking into other options. For example, I used to get cheeseburgers at Jack in the Box, now I am a big fan of their chicken sandwiches. They are equally delicious, just in a different way. 
 <br><br>

Regarding the problem of overfishing, it makes you think that we are even overeating the ocean, yet parts of the world are still in hunger, how are we going to solve this? After watching wasted, I think the answer is to waste less food, there are so many ways food is wasted, if we eliminate food waste starting from the farm to the table, we would be having a lot more edible food for everybody.

Before I watch the film “Cowspiracy,” the only thing I know about the cow industries is the methane emission. However, after I watched this film, what I’ve come to realize from watching, “Cowspiracy”, is that animal agriculture contributes to more than just methane emissions. It contributes to increased carbon dioxide emissions, water depletion, produces nitrogen oxides, and leads to deforestation, and overgrazing. Now I have realized how much harm the cow industries would bring to Earth. We need to consume less meat and dairy product. For many times I have been tried to not to consume meat but it’s not so easy to do so. However, I found that now it’s a lot more easier with the new creations of fake meat products and a bigger market for vegetarian options. Although it’s not that tasty, but it’s still can satisfy the feeling of having meat. I hope that with the spread of information about meat consumption and animal agriculture being the top contributor to climate change that people, including myself, will be more inclined and take harsher action to alter lifestyles.

My outlook is similar to yours – before watching Cowspiracy, and before coming to this class, I was unaware of how much the meat industry contributes to global warming. The film also explores the horrors that these animals go through, along with how it affects our planet, as you point out, contributing to additional carbon dioxide emissions, water depletion, overgrazing, etc. It’s difficult not to consume meat, but I firmly believe that as more people begin to learn about how bad meat production is for our planet, we will be able to limit it. The film was very surprising overall, but very informative.

<br><hr>
You make some great points here. The key to cutting down methane emissions is to simply eat less meat. The climate implications of eating meat are far more than just methane released from cows. Eating meat also adds to one's carbon footprint because of the traveling necessary to deliver the meat, the deforestation for more grazing land, and depletes our water supplies. Eating beef is legitimately one of the worst things you can do for the environment.
 <br><br>


I also believe you made a great point by pointing out meat alternatives. You are completely right they really aren't as good as the taste of natural meat, at least to myself, but as Ken demonstrated in the lecture video, sometimes self-sacrifice is necessary when considering the greater good of the planet. I personally have recently gotten into tofu. It's a great vegetarian alternative to meat and it's easy enough to choke down, especially when I think about how much less I'm contributing to my carbon footprint. On top of that, switching to a largely plant-based diet is another nice start to reducing methane emissions, and it's just as healthy for you if not healthier.

<br><hr>
We definitely need to eat less meat. It is unnecessary to include meat in each and every meal in order to have a healthy diet, and it is probably more unhealthy to do so anyways. The main issue that arises from excluded meat from your diet entirely is the vitamins and minerals that only can be attained from meat products. These vitamins can be acquired from pills, but not anyone has access to that. Furthermore, the vegan/vegetarian options are good, but they can be more expensive and are not in all stores, so people may not have the facilities to get this. But I have tried to reduce my meat consumption, but I find it very difficult to do so. I definitely should to work on this however in order to be a better steward of my environment. Nonetheless, the meat industry is a premier propagator of the climate crisis.

I think that the film did an excellent job of communicating the subject. Filmmaker Kip Anderson was able to effectively communicate the subject to his audience with the use of numerous facts. Not only did these facts bring awareness to people about the agriculture business, but he also added graphics to help people visualize the destruction of the agriculture business. Kip Anderson showed the viewers how many cities, states, and countries could be filled every year combined with all of the waste that cows produce each year. Kip also had many interviews with environmental organizations. In these interviews he showed the audience that even these organizations are not taking into account the effects of agriculture.  I believe the film's audience could be anyone interested in learning about environmental issues, or for people already concerned with them. A target audience could be for those who eat meat very rarely or for those who are already vegetarian. Right off the bat I was shocked to learn how much water is needed to create just one pound of beef. It was mind-blowing to see how much water is being wasted for raising cattle in order to create meat and cheese. My response to this film was intellectual because the film was providing factual evidence and avoided appealing to your emotions. However, I was appalled when these so-called climate change activists were blatantly ignoring or denying the agricultural effects on our oceans and lands. The film caused me to think about how we as a whole planet could lower our production of beef and other animal products. It is highly unrealistic to completely stop the use of animal products. I learned a lot of brand new information from this film. This film was highly informative and comprehensible. I learned that at the current destruction rate of the amazon rainforest, it may be completely gone within the next ten years. This film made me feel very pessimistic about our future. Trying to change a whole culture to lower their intake of meat is highly unlikely and most likely impossible. In order to stop the destruction being caused by agriculture, there needs to be an equal alternative. I think it is a very informative film that could help catalyze people to make changes in their lives.

I have been vegan since my freshman year of high school and “Cowspiracy” really speaks on everything I stand for. Eating a plant based diet is not as difficult as one might think and plant powered proteins are just as satiating as protein from the flesh of animals.
 <br><br>
Aside from ethical and health reasons that are some of the main appeals of veganism, I think that eating a plant-based diet just makes so much more sense. Plants are able to provide all the nutrients that one needs to survive and thrive. Today, there are so many vegan alternatives including imitation meat, vegan mayo, vegan cheese, vegan eggs, vegan whip cream, and so much more. It has never been easier to eat a plant-based diet especially with growing vegan restaurant establishments including Plant-Power Fast Food, Monty’s Goodburger, etc. Even chain restaurants like Red Robin, the Cheesecake Factory, Carl’s Junior, Burger King, Taco Bell, T.G.I Fridays, and more provide meat alternatives for their main menu items. As explained in the video, you can produce 15 times more plant protein than animal protein with the same amount of land. 
 <br><br>


Even as a vegan I support those who are raising their own livestock. I think it is important to see where your food is coming from and realizing that meat comes from real animals that were once living. If you can’t bear to see your food being killed and cut apart, why are you okay with eating meat? This is an example of how many Americans live selfishly and without regard or concern of where what they consume comes from whether it be food, clothes, or accessories. Kip Anderson says, “If I can’t do it I don’t want someone else to be doing it for me.” I think more people need to feel this way when it comes to what they put on their plate. I couldn’t agree with Howard Lyman more when he claimed that you cannot call yourself an environmentalist if you consume meat, dairy, and eggs. We have so much control over what we choose to eat in a day and I hope that people will stop and think before they buy and eat their next meal--for themselves, the animals, the workers in the system, and the environment.

I have to admire your courage that you become as a vegan and insist it even until today. It is a great things. I strongly agree with you that it is very easy of being vegan today and it is really not that hard. My personal story is the best example that I was a kind of person who loves meat. I can only eat meat for weeks without any fruits and vegetables. Sadly, I had a lot of health issue even when I was a kid. I do not have enough and balanced vitamin even though I eat a lot of meat. I had a weigh issue since I was 8. Being the fat boy in the class was never a happy thing. I start to become partial vegan that I only eat vegetables on every Monday. I started hard but generally, I realized it was not that hard at all. A lot of different alternative not only provide as much if not more nutrients, the tastes are not even bad at all. America is one of the countries among the world that are very nice to vegans that a lot of restaurants provide vegan options. I generally increase my date of eating vegetables only from once a week to 3 times a week. After a year's eating habit, not only my weigh get lost, I actually have a better body. It is stupid that we are doing something which hurts the earth and hurts ourselves whereas we give up the choice which is beneficial for both.


<br><hr>
I for sure agree with you that not only does eating a plant-based diet make so much more sense, but in today's world it is almost impossible to dismiss this because it is "too challenging." I became vegetarian my sophomore year of high school and to this day my grandfather still doesn't understand why I choose to live this way. He makes remarks like "God put animals on this planet for us to eat" and I can, in a way, see where he is coming from. At one point in time, it made sense for us to eat meat. This was the most efficient way for us to gain our nutrients when we lived as hunters and gatherers. I find it almost impossible to argue now, however that this is still the case. We now live in a world where not only is it completely doable to live on a diet free of meat, but it is also extremely wasteful and detrimental to society to consume it. 
 <br><br>


The meat industry is harmful for so many reasons. The way animals are treated in this industry is completely unethical, which shows human's lack of respect for any species other than their own. Even more than this, the meat industry is completely wasteful. As ken stated, this industry causes almost all environmental issues plaguing our world such as deforestation, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, erosion, species extinction, and many more. Not only is this the case, but the act of eating meat is extremely wasteful in itself. Just like you brought up, you can produce fifteen times the plant protein that is produced by animals with the same amount of land. There is nothing beneficial that comes from the meat industry other than satisfying the demand of selfish, uninformed consumers. There is no need to consume meat the way we do in America and I also hope that people stop and think before sacrificing the good of the planet for an ephemeral craving.

After watching the film, even though the filmmaker said we should stop eating meat and become vegan, I think it's too hard for everyone to achieve this. If suddenly someone is asked to stop eating meat, he/she will feel uncomfortable since he/she eats meat every day before. I think there should be more lectures or films that can educate people about the negative impact of eating meat. Only by doing these, people can realize how bad eating meat is, and it also takes time for them to change from a meat-based diet into a plant-based diet. In addition, I think the expense of buying meat can also influence the consumption of meat. If the meat is too expensive to buy,  I believe there will be a decline in the amount of meat that was consumed by people.

I agree that many might find switching an arguably major lifestyle choice to be difficult, if not impossible. However, with companies such as Beyond Meat and other plant based meat alternatives, there is a way to maintain similar taste and flavor profiles while reducing the food's carbon footprint. Plant based meat alternatives can be intimating and unappetizing to some but many who seek to reduce their food's carbon footprint can do so without sacrificing the taste and feeling of a certain food. As we become more informed on the environmental consequences of our lifestyle choices, innovations are allowing for an easier switch into a more sustainable life.

When I saw Cowspiracy I could not believe that most environmentalists do not put Cow plantations as a number one issue. It impacts the most towards climate change and society itself. It causes forests like the amazon to have higher rates of forest fires. This causes climate change because when there are more forest fires, there is more co2 that goes up in the air and also we lost the trees that take in the co2.  It also causes problems for ocean life from all the waste that comes from the plantation so far. I could not believe that plantations just dump all this waste into the ocean which kills the species. Lastly, it is affecting our water resources. I could not believe that one burger takes as much as a 2-month shower. JUST ONE BURGER. There must be hundreds of burger each day which show how much water we wasted. 
 <br><br>


There might be even more problems from cow plantations, but the real problem is that these environmentalists are not doing anything to fix this problem. There to scared to say anything because they don't want to lose their funding which I think is complete bull crap. Like cmon, if plantations are the main problem we have to fix it and not just watch it happen. Environmentalist jobs are to help the environment, not earn all this money. I believe that if we do nothing to change cow plantations for at least the next 10 years, then we will face major consequences.

I think the file is effective at communication its subject. As he grabs the audience's attention about animal agriculture is one of the main causes of deforestation, water consumption and pollution. The fact he points out scared the audience, which makes audiences will try to make a difference to save the world. As no one wants our planet to die. I believe the film's audiences are casual viewers. It is because in the film he already said no one talks about animal agriculture in our major world. Therefore, he wants to make a film to tell the audience the truth he finds out, which is wrong. I like the film and the filmmaker. As the starting point is good. But I don't like the filmmaker don't do enough research before gives out the conclusion. The truth is animal products account for about 15% of total greenhouse gas emissions, not over 50%. He gives the audience the wrong information. Although this will strengthen his point, that is base on an wrong data. I can't accept that. But I will still recommend this film to my friends. I rate this film as a 3.5 star. If the filmmaker uses the right data, then this is a 5 stars film.

After watching "Cowspiracy," my eyes were really opened to the effect that the meat industry, specifically the beef industry has on the environment. From deforestation, to water pollution, to methane emissions, I had no idea how far reaching and damaging these industries could be on the environment. The statistic that 51% of all greenhouse emissions are from Animal Agriculture and that it was the number one contributor to human caused climate change shocked me and now after learning from Ken that this figure was off is slightly disturbing as the whole movie relied heavily on this figure as evidence of agribusiness’s effect and contribution to global warming. The point where the film focused on how none of the environmental agencies who work on rainforest deforestation would talk about animal agriculture except for Amazon Watch who brought it up and when asked about why none of these companies speak out she said it is of fear from retribution from the cattle industry interest as people in the past had been killed for speaking out against the industry. This explains why many of the other environmental organizations declined to comment on the impact that the beef industry has had on climate change as they are clearly scared of the retributions and consequences of speaking out against one of the most powerful industries in the world. Another part of the movie that stood out to me was when one of the environmental organizations would not comment on whether they receive contributions from any part of the beef industry as such contributions would clearly skew their reporting on environmental issues. The fact that many of these organizations would not talk or post anything on their websites about the effect that animal agriculture is having on the environment. The last point that the film made about the disconnect between killing animals and eating animal products also really struck home with me when I watched one of the interviewees kill his duck. Seeing Kip reflect on watching this slaughter resonated to me because I also had a similar reaction of being disgusted when I watched the scene. Given how I eat chicken all the time without hesitation and how if I watched a chicken being killed and then was asked if I would want to eat it, my reaction would be different and I would definitely hesitate if I had to watch the animal being killed or even had to kill it myself. After watching the film, I now better understood how the disconnect between eating meat and realizing that we are killing living animals is growing in our society.

I share the same argument. The documentary "Cowspiracy' explores the impacts of animal agriculture on environmental sustainability.  This documentary talks about the inconvenient truths big corporations and even environmental organizations do not want to hear. To add to your point, I found it truly compelling when Kip mentions that environmental communities are failing us by refusing to expose the beef industry. I understand why you say environmentalists would rather keep their mouth shut than to speak out against the big industries/ government because they fear the backlash. Many amazon environmentalists from Brazil have been murdered for voicing their discontent for rainforest deforestation. The documentary was crowdfunded as the original investors back out from funding it due to the ramification they could have faced for putting out such an honest film. Before I watched this film, I had no idea how many organizations feared the beef industry. If environmental communities are unable to voice factual evidence out of fear, then who will? 
<br><br>
I also like when you said we are disconnected from animals and wildlife. Seeing those happy ducks be slaughtered was truly heartbreaking. I never imagined the devastation poor helpless livestock go through. Wildlife has also been massively affected. Earth biomass is composed of 98% (humans+ livestock) and 2% (wildlife). Agribusiness is responsible for the deforestation of the rain forests and other wildlife properties. Birds, amphibians, lizards, mammals, and fish are dying every day. This is extremely upsetting how the greed of humanity has taken its toll on innocent animals who have been here before us.
<br><hr>
I’m glad you also felt as though the agricultural industry is a large factor in the cause of the climate crisis. When farmers and environmentalists turn their heads in disbelief of the inaction of government legislation on the livestock and agricultural fields you know you have a real problem. The large industries such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals are the ones in power. Their lobbyists and hold of power in this country is daunting. They are the ones who create the legislature which affects their business. Is it not clear to anyone who is involved that, they are only serving their own self interests? Is it any surprise, after seeing what has happened to those in brazil, that environmental efforts and organizations would steer clear of livestock? The potential loss of funding and revenue towards these organizations would be enough to silence them. So, with full knowledge of the consequences of their actions, or rather inactions, the environmental organizations are seemingly dismissing the livestock industry and absolving them of all misdeeds. 
<br><br>
It seems like every week I’m being told that there is a new environmental problem. It gets harder and harder to say “well, if we all change this, this, and this then we could solve the climate crisis”. Because the answer is becoming abundantly clear to me. We have way too many people on this planet. We don’t need 7.75 billion of us. We make up about 97% of all living animals if you include our animals and food. Should we really have all the power in the world, to make places that once thrived with wildlife, but now are used for human purposes. For agriculture, for natural resources, for cities. I’m finding harder and harder to justify human societies continued trend of more and more resources being used. The worst part is that I doubt I’ll even do anything after all this. I’m guessing that I’m not going to be vegan, I’m probably not going to become a minimalist. More than likely, I will continue to disproportionately pollute along with the rest of this planet until my inevitable passing.

I really agree with you that I also changed my attitude towards eating chicken or being a vegetarian a lot, since I never thought to be before.The film was so effective at communicating the great harm that was caused by eating meat and the animal agriculture. The reason Andersen conveyed this film’s subject so successfully was the introducing way. He narrated his experiences to the audiences as someone sharing his new findings with his friends. Also, he backed up his claim with a bunch of statistics, presenting in a way of charts and histogram, which effectively showed the seriousness of the problem. 
<br><br>
I was shocked when watching the film. Since I never thought that 80% of rainforest was destroyed for cattle and 1100 activists were gunned down to speak out against cattle ranching in the last 20 years in Brazil. My response is emotional since I wasn’t aware of how serious the effects are, and it may even cause the deforestation. This documentary also caused me to think other reasons to be vegetarians expect the environmental one. And I find that I believe animals have at least some moral status to be treated nicer and grow in natural circumstances. And I feel quite optimistic about this, since more and more people are now realizing this problem and we are all devoted to change the current situation.

After watching the film Cowspiracy, I think I have the similar feeling as you. It is really incredible that the animal industry can cause such great climate distraction: water, air and forest are all destroyed by this industry. However, the most serious problem I see is that the animal industry has really large power all over the world which means most of the large environment protection organizations do not dare to address the really situation to the public. As a result, public people Do not know the actual truth of what is the prominent factor of the climate change, so that it is really hard for us to take action. 
<br><br>

 Before watching this film, I had never realize that the meat industry has such bad influence on the environment and waste such many of resources. I always heard that being a vegan can help the protection of environment, but I have never really understand why. I think for many people being a vegan can be kind of hard, but try to have a more and more plant based diet and try not to waste food can be extremely practical for most of us. As we know all these information we should try to tell people around us, and start to practice ourselves to help save the Earth



<br><hr>
Something in particular that I really appreciated about your response here is that it was incredibly relatable. I similarly had the same flashback while watching this film where I reflected upon the fact that I eat chicken all the time without hesitating. How would it be if I had to kill my own animals for myself, or watching them being killed each time, knowing what I was eaten attached to this vivid memory or image. However, like you summarize at the end of your response, it all comes down to that there has grown this disconnect between meat eating and killing animals. While this certainly delves into animal cruelty, Cowspiracy goes more in depth than just surface level things we see, but big time impacts that we feel and go through environmentally. It was probably in one of my environmental science classes (I have been in several) when I was first introduced to this concept that meat causes environmental issues through methane. My first memory of this goes back to cows and the methane they release at mass due to us mass producing cows for our many purposes. It is not just in this movie, but other documentaries as well, but particularly, the first time I saw this film, I also had a lasting memory of what you talked about where the environmental organization refused to comment on their environmental impacts. These people decline and refuse to accept, and hide from the truth. I remember feeling like this was so cowardly and I felt extremely turned off by this.

I hear you. I think that it is clear that the solution to this massive problem in terms of the expanding agribusiness decreasing percent of wildlife that represents the earth's biomass is to address the consumption of meat, specifically beef in our society. These landscapes such as rainforests like the Amazon that are being destroyed to either feed livestock through developing land for the production of genetically engineered and pesticide sprayed soy beans or for livestock to graze on need to be restored and the practice of continual deforestation and destruction of natural habitats are surely a cause of why the 2% figure represents the total percentage of wildlife that makes up the earth's biomass. As for solutions to this problem, it would be best if people could make their own decisions to reduce their own meat consumption so that the government does not have to intervene and impose policies that may be controversial. The reason I say this is because as we have seen with the issue of climate change as a whole, when the government tries to get involved and get behind preserving the environment through the Green New Deal for example the issue instantly becomes partisan. The reason this is, is fundamentally because of conservative's being cautious and weary of the expansion of government while liberal politicians push for government intervention to solve the crisis. While political deadlock seems to be what would happen if intervention by the government would to occur in the agribusiness not to mention the problem of the extreme power of the animal agriculture industry which very likely is already in the pockets of many politicians the only option for change can come from a grassroots movement that does not rely on politics and powerful individuals to create true change. What would this change look like? I'm not sure but we must take some sort of collective action to address this issue now.

I am truly shocked about all the information and truth told in this Cowspiracy documentary. Us humans are really exploiting the planet every second, from the moment we wake up and drink a glass of milk, to the clothes we put out, the car we drive, the food we eat every day. When climate issue is talked about, the direct pollution and impact such as the effects of the fossil fuel industry are always brought up. However, those indirect impacts caused by animal agriculture and revealed in this film are rarely mentioned. I was shocked to find out the amount of resources put into raising those cows and the significant and wide-range side effects, such as deforestation, methane increase, ocean pollution, species extinction. What's even more unbelievable and disappointing is those environmental groups who I once recognized and believed in their efforts put into making change stay silent on this leading cause issue. And how astonishing that people who stand out and advocate for animals and the environment were threatened and killed. I was truly sad to see how those human-raised animals were exploited, again and again, born to be eaten. How selfish we are that we take animals' homes, families, their kids, all things that they have until nothing is left, and then we kill them. It's devastating. And I think this person who made this documentary is very brave, and we need more people like him to tell the truth.

“Cowspiracy” is effective at communicating its subject which is pointing out that animal agriculture is actually the leading cause of environmental destruction such as deforestation, water pollution, etc. Anderson presents a lot of data and interviews to support his argument, especially those interviews that show animal agriculture is such a sensitive topic to talk about, which makes this film more convincing. I learned that animal agriculture is actually causing huge destruction in our environment and the fact that we over cultivate plants and over-fishing in order to run animal agriculture. It makes me feel that while keep doing all the stuff we already know to save the environment, we should eat less meat as well. After watching it, I feel more pessimistic because it seems the leading agents of organizations of environmental protection are not going to take action and that not everyone is willing to change their eating habits, it is a tough problem to solve.

The director uses a really special view to indicate one of the most horrible environmental secret in the world which is animal husbandry, and he uses different kinds of outcomes to indicate the ponderance of this issue.
<br><br>
I think the people who are casual viewers might be the film’s audience because when we see this title, we will feel curious and will not figure out what the real topic of the film is. Also, the aims of this film must want to introduce how serious overgrazing is and tell more people who have never notice about.Firstly, I thought overgrazing is not that kind of serious and I think it will only affect little things such as grass. However. Gradually, I found that it was much more serious than I thought, and I was emotionally moved by the horrible outcomes of overgrazing. I have never known about overgrazing relating to the soil, the atmosphere, and even the oceans which are almost our earth. Of course, I learnt how serious overgrazing is and how it relates to the destroying of our earth. After watching it, I feel optimistic because I think more people taking action after watching this. For me, I will try to notice more news about grazing. It likely that I would recommend to my friends because milk is one of the most important food in our daily lives, so I will tell them how serious overgrazing is and try to learn these kinds of news more.

I agree with Josie that "Cowsipracy" does an adequate job in bringing to light the problem that is contributing the most to climate change. Many believe it is car pollution but as the film mentions the biggest problem is animal agriculture. I also agree with Josie that the film was able to support its claim with facts and data that show that animal agriculture is the main contributor to climate change. It would be easier said than done if we all could change our diets to a healthier and self-sustaining one but the truth is that many people are opposed. People have lived their lives the way that they have wanted and being told what to eat is not appealing to a lot. I think that those who are willing to change their diet should and those who are not really should try to limit the food that they waste. Both methods will help and be beneficial in fighting against climate change. All in all, the film was informative and addressed the main contributor to climate change which is animal agriculture.

<br><hr>
 Following what Raul said, I also agree that "Cowspiracy" did a good job expressing that animal agriculture might be the most important and the most efficient way to combat climate change. Kip Anderson, the producer behind "Cowspiracy", did a great job in translating the gravity of the situation in regards to animal agriculture and the damage it is doing to the environment. Animal agriculture is currently one of the main producers of carbon and it is largely known that cows are the worlds greatest polluter of methane, combined with the inhumane quality of care that animals are put through when raised as livestock, animal agriculture is a complete evil in all moral senses. Much of the food even created is thrown away and is classified as a waste for visual imperfections and overall side effects. All in all, I really felt like "Cowspiracy" did a good job in exposing the problem with food waste and its connections with the animal agriculture culture that resides in the United States and other first-world countries.
<br><hr>
Yes. There is an invisible chain tightened every species, including us, and the environment together. Our behavior matters. Just like you said overgrazing is relating to the soil, the atmosphere, and even the oceans, I heard that even tiny species, like bees, have an important role in our ecosystem, there are over 1330 crops that are essential to our daily lives, and more than 1000 of them rely on bee’s pollination to reproduce. So there is a famous prediction that if bees go extinct, human can only live for four more years. Anyways, my point is that we should have responsibility for everything we do, and we should try our best to protect our future.

<br><hr>

Yes, I agree with you, collective actions are needed. People don’t see value in personal reductions because they assume that individual-level reductions don’t make any difference, but if you started to put in actions, people around you might get influenced by your efforts, changed their minds and join you as well. So we should all start with ourselves, sacrifice a little bit by eating less meat, especially beef. And we are not only doing this for ourselves but for our future generations.

The beginning of Cowspiracy started with a man speaking passionately about increasing ppm and temperature rise, but once he was asked about livestock, he had nothing to say. This comes to show how animals are put on the backburner of many humans’ minds when it comes to relating them to climate change. There IS more to climate change than just fossil fuels. 
<br><br>

The comparison of 660 gallons of water for a single hamburger astonished me. When you think of meat you genuinely don’t think of how much water was being used in the process. To put it into an even larger perspective, 2,500 gallons of water makes one pound of beef...ONE! Seeing how massive of a dent animal agriculture puts on both climate change and the environment in general is horrible to see and take in, that it really encouraged me to fully cut out beef in my diet. 
<br><br>

One thing that really bothered me was how organizations who strive to enforce environmentally friendly ways of living still focus on the money they make from donors, instead of what humans can truly do to make larger impacts against anthropogenic climate change. What was the point of putting out information about ways to “save” the environment when all they really want to do is save themselves from losing donors. If these organizations were really concerned about our planet, change in diet would be a leading solution that would be plastered all over their sites. 
<br><br>

On the other hand, hearing numerous people are killed as a consequence of speaking up against cattle ranching and agribusiness was shocking. “Animal rights and environmental activists are the number one domestic terrorism threat according to the FBI.” That is insanity. Why is it that these activists are being targeted in such a way? Again, this refers back to the sole idea of corporations wanting to make a profit, keeping those profits, and boosting those profits. Corporations must deny any opinion that contradicts their stance on whatever they are selling. Humans are not aware of the harm beef consumption exerts on the planet, and big corporations with power and money would rather keep boosting profit than save all living beings from the sixth mass extinction. Yes, I know this last statement was a long stretch, but if you think about all we have learned in the course thus far, it is apparent that humans are choosing to blindly walk on the path towards our downfall.

Like you, I was shocked to hear that animal rights and environmental activists are the number one domestic terrorism threat according to the FBI. Is saving animals really more dangerous than guns or bombs? That’s a hard statement to wrap my brain around, but I do agree with you when you say that this refers back to profits. We live in a capitalist society in which making profits trumps everything. Corporations focus on money over the climate and that’s a hegemonic idea that we have to change in order to make progress in the right direction.

<br><br>

Another part of the film that really impacted me was the duck slaughtering scene. I think including the gruesome scene in the film really helps spread the message of the detrimental impacts of meat. Watching that scene will definitely cut duck out of my diet, and hopefully push me towards being vegetarian. I know it won’t be easy for me to cut meat out of my life, but I do know that I can make small steps in the direction of consuming a largely plant based diet. After all, I can’t call myself an environmentalist if I eat meat, so becoming vegetarian is the next priority in my life.


<br><hr>
I felt very similar to you when watching the film: disappointed by all the environmental organizations keeping the issue of animal agriculture silent. All of these organizations when asked about animal agriculture and its impact either didn’t know about the topic, pretended not to know, or completely argued Kip’s points. The one interview that stood out to me was when he was interviewing the animal agriculture lobbyists and when asked if they funded organizations like greenpeace, the women got extremely uncomfortable and people in the back were telling her not to answer that. This also is supported by the old greenpeace director admitting they know about the research on animal agriculture, but refuse to admit it. 
<br><br>

The animal agriculture clearly has tremendous amounts of power and will do anything to silence information against them.I also was shocked to hear that people in Brazil were being killed for speaking out and men like Howard Lyman were taken to court just for speaking the truth. It almost makes me feel powerless when I realize how much control the government and large corporations have. However the one thing that we can do is reduce the demand for animal products because with no demand, these corporations have significantly less power. 
<br><br>

As of right now, I currently don’t consume any beef due to the environmental impacts but watching this film made me feel like I really should go to a fully plant-based diet. Even though it would be hard it will be worth it to not waste 660 gallons of water for one burger and 1,000 gallons for one gallon of milk. I think it is also important that people don’t consume fish either because if we continue our rate of fish consumption we will have fishless oceans by 2048, because we catch so much bi kill in the process as well. We truly are on a path of mass extinction if we do not change our eating habits.

In the film, “Cowspiracy '', the producers and makers of the film distinguish and elaborate on the environmental issues. They focus mainly on the food waste, environment castaprohes arising, and the change of a new diet. They emphasize how our diets are a big factor on the gas emissions and how we should reflect on our actions and distinguish on what ways we can reduce food waste. There is roughly around ⅓-½ of food being wasted and how this is a major effect towards the gas emissions and how we should reflect our lifestyles to reduce these percentages and try to make the planet in better conditions. This was sad to see due to all the food being wasted and how in different parts of the world there is a lack of food and resources. I feel like a simple difference in someone’s eating habits can be a big factor and make the difference. This encouraged me to reflect on my own eating habits and try to reduce the amount of food waste that I do. I only get the food that I am actually going to eat and keep in mind that I do not overspend in food. Even though there were some wrong facts, I feel the film still gives good advice and information on the climate and environment issues that are occuring. This allows the audience to be aware of what the planet is going through and try to make a difference in our lifestyle based on food and the animal agriculture.The film gives a good idea on how we should reflect and meditate on our ideas and what possible actions we can take to improve our conditions .I understand that not everybody is willing to change their habits, but the percentage that does still makes a different to the world.

I agree with you. The film was very effective at communicating its subject that animal agriculture plays a major role in global warming and is the leading cause of resource consumption and environmental degradation. The filmmaker, Kip Andersen, bombarded the audience with a great deal of statistics, which added credibility to his claim that livestock greatly influenced the earth’s environment. In order to demonstrate how hugely the difference of waste from the livestock industry is compared to other industries, Kip Andersen then put these numbers in comparison. When I was watching the fishes being killed and rainforest being cut down for livestock industry and hearing the scientists mentioned that the ocean would become fishless by 2048 and the Amazon rainforest could be gone in the next 10 years, I felt upset and powerless. I was also shocked and felt unbelievable when most of the environmental organizations refused to discuss the issue about animal agriculture and rather chose to keep people in dark just because they needed a reliable source of funding. Besides that, it is incredible that I learned the human demand for meat nowadays would cost so much to be achieved and a plant-based diet would be the most sustainable way to reverse the situation. The film changed my attitudes that I should try to eat less meat everyday and do this small part to help save the planet. However, I still feel pessimistic toward this issue since the population is continuing to grow and there will be more demand on meat and sometimes it’s hard to change people’s diet habits.


<br><hr>
I especially agree with your point that not everybody is willing to change their dietary habits but a percentage will still make a difference to the world.  Although this percentage needs to be high in order to make a significant impact on the reduction of the climate crisis, it is still encouraging to see a good amount of people transitioning to a more plant based lifestyle.  I personally believe that if enough people are aware of the immense impact that the meat and dairy industry are having on the environment, there will continue to be an upwards trend in the transition to a plant based lifestyle.  The film does an amazing job in communicating this to the audience, as it creates awareness around the ties between the food industry and the growing climate crisis.  Through the many statistics thrown out during the film and the real life footage of environmental destruction, it is difficult not to feel even a little bit more motivated to tailor your eating/living habits.  I personally am a vegetarian myself but am highly considering a full vegan lifestyle because of the benefits it brings to mitigating the climate crisis.  Although it will be very hard to change people's behavior towards food and agriculture, I am rather optimistic as more films like Cowspiracy are building a substantial amount of awareness.

It's very frustrating that these are organizations such as the Sierra Club and Oceana, who we would all hope to be on the side of the truth, yet people always seem to be swayed by power and influence. While Project Drawdown outlined 80 top solutions to the climate crisis, Cowspiracy points out that even those who seem to be our allies in this crisis aren't doing nearly the most to address it. What's even the point of promoting lightbulb changes and watering your lawn less if the cattle industry is overwhelmingly outdoing those reductions?
<br><br>

My personal reaction to this film wasn't as personal, but that showed me something. Being Hindu, my family does not consume beef. So watching Cowspiracy, I almost began to feel a sense of disconnectedness with the issue, almost that I was looking down on the average American for consuming beef. Sometimes I watch people ask for extra meat in the line at DLG and I almost judge them. I was appalled by the fact that it requires 660 gallons of water to produce a quarter pound hamburger; seeing the dozens of burgers being served at DLG every day, I would just like to repeat that statistic to every person who picks up a burger from there. 
<br><br>

I had to catch myself. From watching the film I needed to remember that my non-beef meat, egg, and dairy consumption was contributing to the problem. For every 1 gallon of milk that my family consumes, 1,000 gallons of water are being consumed as well. I am seriously considering switching to an all-plant based diet, starting with vegetarianism and switching next to veganism.
<br><br>

And as I've stated, I've been thinking about our dining halls at UCSB. I've seen advertisements for "Green Mondays" at Carrillo, where no meat products are served for all three meals. While this is definitely more impactful than doing Meatless Mondays once a week, I question why we don't do this more often. Imagine if an entire dining hall only served non-meat/plant-based products. It could happen at Ortega, which is close to DLG. So if people aren't down for vegetarian/vegan options, they can just go to DLG? This may be difficult to implement and may not appeal to all students, but if we're talking about cultural change, we might as well start on our own campus!

Each of us can make a significant dent in the climate crisis if all of us adopt a largely plant based diet, this will reduce global carbon emissions by 137 gigaton of CO2 emissions. I was stunned to hear that switching to renewable energy in the form of solar panels will reduce emission by less than half of this amount.  More and more people are adopting some variation in their diet such as being pescatarian, vegetarian, or vegan. But in America people who have adopted these diets are still a very small minority of wealthy, educated people. There are currently 486 vegan restaurants in the USA, most of which are relatively expensive. However, this is a large increase compared to only 55 in existence in 1993, less than 30 years ago. Changing our diet is something each of us can do relatively easily, even without everyone becoming vegan, if everyone reduces their meet consumption my a fraction of what they are consuming now, this could drastically impact the meet industry and therefore certainly reduce CO2 emissions significantly.

I was shocked after watching this film. In the past, I, like many other audiences, used to think that the main causes of greenhouse gas were from the transport system and power industries. I also searched the internet for this kind of topic, and the result was just like the ones mentioned in the film——” raising of livestock” was absent on the webpage. It is hard to imagine that 2500L water is consumed to produce only each 114g hamburger. I was never informed that animal agriculture is the principal offender of so many serious environmental problems. Moreover, the reason why lots of officers in the environment organization refused to answer this problem directly, the huge profit chain and the dark side behind animal agriculture, shocked me as well. It was new to know that the animal agriculture industry spends a lot of money to force the public to be silent, just like what the fossil fuel industry does. What makes me angry is that people kill lots of carnivores, like coyotes and wolves to “protect” livestock. “protect”? No, people just keep the “things” that can bring them profits and enjoyment. Livestock is nothing more but like toys that can make babies happy. And just for this, people kill any other lives, creatures, that threaten their enjoyment. What does life mean to you? Recently, there is a lot of news online about the Australian fire, and many videos of animal injuries due to the fire's damage to habitats, which makes people feel sad. But why don’t people feel sad when hundreds of and thousands of livestock and carnivores are being killed? Is it just because they don't look cute enough?
<br><br>

To be honest, I respect this filmmaker’s braveness and a sense of social responsibility. Knowing that Sister Dorothy Stang was killed simply because she pointed out the problems behind animal agriculture, the author is still doing what he thinks is right. What a warrior! Last but not least, lots of lands will return to nature if more people try to be vegetarian. After watching this film, I feel pessimistic that quite an amount of meat is consumed every day, and only a few people realize the truth. Eating no meat may be difficult for me, but I will try to do my best to help the environment and the planet.

I too was shocked after watching Conspiracy and hearing all of these facts (and some debatable facts) about the food industry. I had prior knowledge that food and its production are a major industry, but I did not realize that in Brazil said industry had people killed if opposing opinions were voiced just like they pay off organizations in America to be quiet. The dark side of the industry scared me as it reminded me of the fossil fuel agencies who pay their way into the government and avoid necessary carbon taxes due to "lack of scientific knowledge". This film alarmed me as I did not realize how much land one cow needs in order to graze, making grass-fed cows worse than meat-farm cows. Hearing the farm family say that they did not believe the cows and their emissions were affecting the world and its atmosphere hurt me as I know there are people who genuinely believe that statement is true. 
<br><br>

One thing I found extremely surprising is that the people in the actual industry of dairy: farmers, directors, and factory workers knew that the meat and dairy industry is not sustainable when it comes to the demands and the growing rate of the population. I was shocked to hear someone in that industry say that a plant based diet would be the best and most sustainable and just like the man who was sued by the Cattle industry you cannot be an environmentalist if you support the cattle and agri industry. As someone who has been raised eating various types of meat it has been hard for me to try to take meat out of my diet completely. I used to be a pescatarian until I understood that our fish were being killed at rapid rates and the fishing industry was more corrupted than I thought before. Now I try to eat a plant based diet as best as I can but every once in a while I consume meat. After watching this video I realized that a lot of people forget that what they are eating used to be alive. When I first went to the Central Valley and saw all the cows I realized how cute they can actually be and it puts a face to the food you consume if you do eat meat. While I try my best to not eat meat and stay away from animal products I do let myself every once in a while but from now on I am going to try to do a better job eating a plant based diet.

“ What in God's name is freegan vegan?” - Ron Swanson ( Parks and Rec ) 
<br><br>

 I remember hearing this in Parks and Rec and thought it would be a good idea because I am aware of how much food supermarkets waste. I was surprised to learn from this lecture that it is something people do and how much it can help the environment. I do not think it’s something I would devote to but I can follow a plant-based diet. This will be a challenge because we may not be able to ask everyone to change their diets but try to appeal by asking for a step down from what they normally consume. I can follow a plant-based diet but I know many of my family members like my grandfather would never agree with that. He strongly believes you need to eat meat to be healthy. The Ron Swanson character represents people like my grandfather who would not be willing to stop consuming meat, what are successful methods to convince them to eat LESS meat?

The Documentary Cowspiracy was very eye-opening because I was not aware of the environmental impacts that the animal agriculture industry had on our planet. It was shocking to learn that animal agriculture produces more greenhouse gases than fossil fuel industries. Kip Anderson’s attempt to speak with major environmental organizations left me baffled and disturbed because they refused to cooperate or even address the issue. Their hypocrisy and disregard concerning the detrimental impacts of the meat industry changed my attitude toward these major environmental organizations. They usually ask for donations from people and I am now hesitant to continue donations. I learned organizations claim to expose global environmental problems but also have their agendas and they refuse to approach the serious problems because they don't want to lose “support”. This is one of the reasons even people who are in the environmental community are not aware of the agricultural impact because their campaigns mostly revolve around plastic bags, fossil fuels, and trash. Learning that Anderson’s stats were wrong and animal production only accounts for 15% of global emissions made me doubt the rest of the stats he presented. I still believe the impact but I think other people would completely disregard what he said because it will make it seem like he exaggerates everything.

I too struggled watching Cowspiracy.  I cannot disagree with the filmmaker, that environmental advocacy groups like Greenpeace and Oceana were not overwhelmingly helpful in divulging helpful information about the animal agriculture industry.  However, I just really didn't understand why he was not more clear.  Whether we like it or not, organizations cannot function without funding.  It would be naive to assume that 100% of all of these donations or contributions would be shared transparently to the public.  We know this, and honestly companies know that we know about this too.  It was frustrating to watch Anderson take on these corporate giants with very pointed questions that were extremely open-ended. I understand it isn't Andersons fault, but he consistently left these groups massive wiggle room to skirt around the topic at hand, or feign ignorance.  Companies and organizations know that they basically don't have to admit anything that can't be explicitly proven.  So, after watching the documentary, it was difficult to tell if there was truly a government backed cowspiracy controlling all of the environmental organizations, or if Anderson was asking unclear open questions with very little data.  He worked so hard for the opportunity to confront these people and basically allowed them every opportunity to claim innocence.  It was sad that there were some issues with incorrect statistics in the documentary.  You do have to consider how that affects the integrity of the film, but it seems important to remember that Anderson is right, that there is something fishy going on among these groups and that hopefully a handful of numerical errors won't be enough for all of the data to be totally thrown out. I am glad he approached these organizations in this way, and it gives me hope that if someone asked the right questions that maybe an answer could be found.

The authenticity and credibility that this film imposes is what makes it really effective in bringing attention to the unspoken repercussions of agribusiness industry, specifically cattle farming. As a meat-lover myself, I understood that it is a very conflicting and controversial topic when you try to call out people for their eating habits. However, in this film Kip Anderson did not focus on the supply and demand issue that is driving this industry; he designed an effective narrative that uncovers the conspiracy that agribusinesses as well as big environmental organizations are trying to hide.
<br><br>
The film was just raw and everybody loves conspiracies, so this take on this issue is really effective. What’s even more compelling is seeing the smeared faces of representatives and leaders of environmental organizations when Andersen presented the facts about the most environmentally destructive industry. Greenpeace, Sierra Club, Surfrider Foundation, Rainforest Action Network, Oceana are organizations that are supposed to be responsible for advocating for the health of the planet, yet they purposely ignore this information to avoid a bad rep from the general public. If they're prioritizing their image to not losing funding, they are just perpetuating the issues that they're fighting for. If they actually wanted to make an immediate impact, putting a focus on people’s diet is a must. The agribusinesses’ power over these organizations and even in the government are accumulated through years of conspired secrecy regarding the effects of raising animals for food consumption. Kip Andersen’s film and discoveries can help us refocus ourselves on climate and ecological preservation action through a single top priority target. By changing our eating habits, we can all make rapid progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, loss of habitat for natural ecologies, and feed a hungry world. We all should use our voices to influence and instigate established environmental groups to tackle central issues. We can no longer afford to raise and eat animals at the pace we're going in.

Very well put. This film undoubtedly called the integrity of the whole agricultural business into question. With its upfront and direct narrative, its aim at exposing the controversial issues largely overlooked by the general public are very pressing matters. I think that alternatives to a meaty diet are simply not popular enough to penetrate the ignorant blissfulness of not knowing how our food is processed. This film definitely merits a sequel that promotes companies like beyond meat or other companies focused on designing synthetic meat. As I see it, meat will never go away. At the pace that we are going, this will only worsen our situation in the existential threat caused by climate change. This class has made me realize something very valuable. The human habits are not going to change. We can only place our hope in the future of technology to save us.

Cowspiracy was an insightful documentary on the meat industry and its contribution to the climate crisis. In the film, Kip Anderson and Keegan Kuhn emphasized that one pound of meat is the equivalent of 2500 gallons of water. For years, people have been emphasizing the need to cut down on water. They’ve introduced ways like using “low-flow showerheads, efficient toilets, water-saving appliances, and fix leaky faucets and sprinkler heads.” In websites like, “Save Our Water,” they’ve only addressed cutting down water consumption within households but not regarding animal agriculture. Exposing the faults in animal agriculture regarding sustainability will be the leading theme within this film. The first time I watched this was in high school; I remember all I could feel was shock because for years, people had been preaching the necessity for cutting down on water intake, but no one ever discussed how much animal agriculture played within it. Cows take up a lot of water to raise and eat. Not only that, but they release a tremendous amount of methane and this is the most powerful greenhouse gas. After watching Cowspiracy, i definetely feel like I need to be thr change that I want to see. While I can't see myself becoming completely vegetarian, I will try to cut down on meat.

<p>
I think Cowspiracy brought up many relevant problems about the animal agriculture industry. However, after finding out that only 15% of greenhouse gases is from animal agriculture, not 51%, it made me second guess the facts presented in the film. What is actually true?
<br><br>

Still, I think some of the points from the film are relevant. First, it shocked me how many organizations refused the effects of animal agriculture. When Kip interviewed numerous organizations, it seemed that each one was hesitant to say anything about animal agriculture. Later in the film, I was appalled to find out that innocent people like Dorothy Stang were being killed for speaking about the negative effects of the agriculture industry. It must have been difficult for Kip to continue with the film knowing that there was a huge target on his back. I just do not understand how this activity is tolerated. This violence goes against all American beliefs. What do environmental organizations have to gain by being quiet?
<br><br>

Another notable part of the film was when the man killed the duck. I had to turn my head. Though it is hard to watch, the message portrayed in this scene is very powerful. Cows, pigs, and chicken are only being raised only to be eaten by humans. People are forgetting the journey of our food before it is served on a plate. If people watched a cow being slaughtered before taking a bite out of a burger, I think people would lose their appetite for meat altogether.

I also watched Cowspiracy and had similar takeaways. The discrepancy between 15% and 51% also made the film less convincing for me. The information in the film could be so far off the truth. If anyone was doubtful of climate change, they could easily point to this fact as an example of alarmist thinking.
<br><br>
I am impressed with Kip for putting the fate of the planet before his personal safety. Even with the fact that people could be killed in Brazil and that those who spoke out were on the FBI’s radar, he continued with the film, prodding organizations to open up about the truth. It is amazing to me how the organizations think that saying they are unwilling to comment will make them look any better than if they told the truth. At that point, the viewers can probably assume what is going on. Why bother hiding anything if it is so clear what you are doing?
<br><br>
I also cringed at the duck slaughtering. I fully expected the camera to pan away or cut to black. That was disgusting. It makes eating meat seem less appetizing due to the brutality of beheading a duck. I agree that people would probably lose their appetite if they watched a cow being slaughtered before eating a burger. However, I would still eat a duck.

What really struck me about Cowspiracy was the fact that so many environmental organizations, both governmental and NGOs, were hesitant or even refused to admit that animal agriculture has such a huge impact on our planet. Throughout the various interviews conducted with organizations such as Oceania, the blatant (if not feigned) ignorance about animal agriculture was shocking if not extremely concerning. The incompetence that the executives of these organizations possess does not bode well for future environmental efforts. Why isn’t animal agriculture a bigger concern for them? Considering the defeatist attitudes some interviewers had, you would think that we are doomed and that the animal agriculture industry is so ingrained in our economy that we will never be able to function without it. 
<br><br>

Another thing that really overwhelmed me throughout the documentary was the plethora of facts about the agriculture industry. The fact that it takes 660 gallons of water to make one hamburger, which is equivalent to two months of showering, showed me that the various actions we take to be environmentally friendly can be offset by the smallest action of eating something. What was also astounding was the fact that 55% of all water use in the U.S. is related to animal agriculture compared to just 5% human use. The amount of energy and resources we put into producing animal products was news for me and I’m thankful that I’ve been vegetarian for a year thus far. The size of the American carbon footprint as a result of meat is unjustified.
<br><br>

Ken made a point in saying that some of the documentary’s facts are not correct. In a sense, by using facts that are incorrect to be alarmist, the documentary’s ethos is destroyed. The climate change deniers assert that that fears of climate change are based on fake evidence. The lies presented in the documentary perpetuate that stereotype and potentially hinder the winning over of climate change skeptics. Ultimately, the way to convince people about the truth is to tell the truth.

I was so relieved to discover that Cowspiracy was not just graphic shots of beef farms and animals getting slaughtered because I could not handle that. It really stuck with me when Kip Andersen said that if he can't kill an animal himself he isn't going to finance someone else to do it. I know this is a climate crisis class, but this ethical concept has been something I've been thinking about for years. How can people be heartbroken about dogs being killed or elephants being shot or whales mistreated when their consumption directly or indirectly funds other animals being killed or seriously harmed. And no, ethically killing an animal is not a thing.
<br><br>

Cowspiracy's statistics get called into question very often. I think it is still important that this film brings into perspective how cows are raised and what resources are used at the expense of animal agriculture. It really forces the audience to be in a broader perspective. Especially if you live in California you understand the severity of a drought and how everyone does their best to help. I personally am someone who loves nature and believes it is important to have certain areas of the land preserved or untouched. So I am glad that that message was being pushed along with other these other ideas. I honestly had no clue the amount of waste livestock produces and it is honestly kind of terrifying.  Michael Klaper saying 50 instead of 15 is such a huge mistake that 100% calls into question his reliability. Especially after throwing shade on a bunch of ecological companies, you should probably make sure all the facts you are using are correct.

True, it is important and necessary to change our diet habit starting now, which is emphasized many times in the documentary “Cowspiracy”. Comparing plant based diet, animal agriculture has wasted far more resources to produce the same amount of nutrition we needed and produce an amount of greenhouse gases. It is unquestionable that having a plant based diet is more environmental friendly than eating meat. However, I believe the film has over exaggerated the consequence and has other purpose beside persuading us to change.
<br><br>

First, the the documentary is exaggerating the data and facts. Every time he points out a data I will involuntary cast doubt on it. He mentions that their are 9 billion people on earth but in fact its only less then 8 billion. Also, he shows that the ratio of conversion between feed and meat is 110 to 1.5. He says it is 100:1, but it is actually 73:1. Maybe he is trying to stress out the negative consequence, but it will make him sound unreliable and untrustworthy. This is the reason why I did not feel good to the film. Also, some of the data he presented is just to enormous to believe, like 150 billion of gallon produced by cattle per day? Although he claims that some data is given by the UN, I wonder where did he get all these numbers.
<br><br>

Moreover, this documentary seems intensionally and viciously attacking the animal agriculture. The entire film is criticizing the agribusiness. Kip Anderson modeled himself as a brave protester against the unjust organization and want to save the planet. However, besides showing us all the terrible outcome of animal agriculture, he dose not give some plausible solution, just vaguely says that we should change our diet. Also, he shows that rarely any organization wants discuss about the problems brought by animal agriculture because the industry has a huge political power and will shut every thing down to maintain their profit. What about the fossil fuels industry? Don’t forget that animal industry is only the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, but Anderson seems trying to avoid talking about it. And if all the environmental organizations are afraid of the political powers behind animal agriculture, why will they criticize coal and oil industry? The political powers behind energy industry is also powerful, perhaps much powerful than the animal industry. Why wouldn’t the organizations afraid of them? For me, I think there is a possibility that Anderson is filming this documentary for the oil industry. It seems just like what the cigarette industry did before: creating a diversion. In the documentary “Merchants of Doubt”, it shows that the cigarettes industry blamed the furniture industry for the reason of fire, so people will ignore the negative impact of cigarettes. This documentary seems like doing the same thing. Blaming the animal agriculture for the major cause of pollution so people will ignore the problems of burning fossil fuels.
<br><br>

Of course, all the perspective are based on my personal guess. Many things in the documentary are worth to know, but I think some points of it are biased.

I have been a vegan for about half a year. In the beginning, I was convinced by Michael Greger’s books and ESS 3 (Nutrition and Health) at UCSB that vegan diets can reduce much Trans-fat that are definitely bad for our blood vessels and would cause numerous cardiovascular disease because all meats, especially red meats, have those Tran-fats. Adopting vegan diets, I begin to find more and more reasons that can justify vegan diets. As I watched “Cowspiracy,” I feel sad and uncomfortable, even watching the duck being murdered. I believe that many people feel the same with me, but most people do not want to think that where they consume come from. Animal right advocate and Nobel Prize laureate JM Coetzee writes in his book “The Lives of Animals” that just like the fact that many people living around concentration camps did not know or chose not to know about what happened to Jews in the concentration camps, although “we are surrounded by an enterprise of ceaseless degradation, cruelty, and killing of animals, […] we closed our heart.” We are just trying to avoid thinking about those killings, comforting ourselves that they died in a humane way. If the argument that the way we keep animals in pain and kill them cruelly is not convincing enough since people disagree with animal rights, would the fact that massive meat consumptions can be harmful to ourselves both in the short term and in the long term not enough for a rational person?

It’s incredible how much of an issue our diets are. I eat meat every day and sometimes twice a day and while I knew it was harmful to the environment I never realized to what extent. It will be very difficult for American society to switch to a plant-based diet or cut down on meat consumption. Many foods which are considered “American” require meat, usually beef. Many people love hamburgers and steaks. And while plant-based meats are gaining traction, they aren’t quite mainstream. A good alternative to regular hamburgers I’ve discovered is the Applegate Blended Burger. They serve it in the dining halls, and it is 50% mushroom and still tastes amazing. I think this is a good step in the right direction, as Americans are unlikely to change the dishes we eat, but given alternatives to beef that still taste

The film Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret, was a very eye-opening movie for me. Watching this film made me a feel a whirlwind of emotions, it honestly made me want to stop eating meat for a while. Before watching this film, I didn't really know much about the meat industry and things of that nature, well I did but not in much detail. I understood it was a cold and heartless and treated animal like actual garbage, but from this film I learned a lot more. I found it funny, in a sarcastic way, that a lot of these so called environmental groups and websites never posted anything about this industry or even made comments about them, they would blame any and everything for the cause of rising greenhouse gas emissions except for the thing that actually caused the most damage. I feel like a lot of people want to avoid talking about animal agriculture, because it's such a huge industry for the world and a lot people don't want to mess things up and frankly probably just don't care. One of the hardest things for me to see while watching the film was when the guy chopped off the ducks head, and the little girl was standing behind him, you can just tell in his eyes that he didn't want to do it, but he had no choice but too because this is what the world wants. I feel like Anderson building his argument on false facts isn't good for his credibility, because it just make it seem like he doesn't really know what he is talking about and that he's only saying things so other people will be on his side, I feel like if you want someone to side with on things like this you need to give them true facts. .

I also found the hypocrisy of these “environmental groups” to be very frustrating and down-right ludicrous. It’s interesting that these groups who are so-called advocates for protecting the environment are avoiding the most pressing and obvious issue to climate change: the meat industry.  I found it very alarming when the Greenpeace organization refused to hold an interview about the topic and many others did not have a direct answer or avoided the topic altogether. This makes you wonder just how much political and social power do these people who run the meat industry really have? For example, the documentary talked about how Howard Lyman had a lawsuit filed against him after exposing the industry publicly on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Under the False Disparagement of Perishable Food Products Act of 1995, Howard underwent a very taxing legal conflict simply for speaking out against them. What kind of law even is the Disparagement of Perishable Food Products Act? While watching the film, I could not help but think about how scary powerful these people are and the political power they hold. The fact that people are being killed, environmental organizations are being silenced, and people avoid talking about it all together is a huge red flag that this is turning into a problem that will continue to happen at increasing rates with almost no restrictions or limitations. 
<br><br>


At this current path, the consequences of the meat industry will be more than disastrous. During the film, the one thing that really enraged and quite frankly scared me was how fast deforestation is occurring just from the cattle industry alone. With the Amazon rainforest possible being completely destroyed in the next 10 years is an eye-opening possibility. At this point, it really makes you realize that we just might truly be in the midst of the world’s 6th extinction. The Amazon rainforest and ocean life have been a part of the world's history since humanity’s earliest existence. But now, we might live to see the complete destruction of it, and for what? I also thought that it was interesting how we could feed the entire world with all the food we are giving to our cattle. Imagine a world that would rather feed cows than human beings, because this is the world we live in. 

<br><br>

But perhaps the biggest question that this film brings is whether or not eating meat and poultry can even be environmentally sustainable. This film provides the evidence that no–the meat, and not even the dairy industry can possibly be sustainable for the human population. This was a huge game-changer for me because it really goes to show that a more plant-based diet will actually be a significant way in which we could live more environmentally friendlier lives. Before, I always questioned whether or not eating meat made that much of a difference. But now, I am definitely more enlightened about the environmental impacts eating meat can have. Although I probably would not be willing to cut meat and dairy out of my diet for good, I will definitely make a better effort to try and cut down on the amount of meat I consume and choose alternative options instead.

While "Cowspiracy" grew on me at first, I still have a bit of a beef with it (pun intended). 

<br><br>

The film chooses to take a completely 'abolitionist vegan' approach to climate change, and in the process of throwing stats at the viewer, fails to address the quality of these facts and the actual nuance in the issue of animal agriculture. I want to preface this by saying that as many people as possible should try to become vegetarian or vegan (or any plant-based diet) since animal agriculture on its current scale is unsustainable. The difference is the quantity in which we consume it and how we choose to produce it. The film fails to prove that more sustainable forms of grazing (i.e. managed grazing) are undeniably worse than CAFOs (factory farms). CAFOs are more space efficient, but at the cost of the ecosystem at large and of the overall quality of life for the cattle. The film also creates confusion over the prioritization of animal agriculture when it first uses a blatantly wrong statistic (51% of total GHGs by animal agriculture over its life cycle), then corrects it to another wrong statistic (18% of total GHGs is also wrong, the actual figure is closer to 14.5% according to the FAO). While this still means that animal agriculture is very significant, it also means that there are other ways to combat climate change that we should focus just as much on, especially increasing efficiency of current plant agriculture and reducing food waste (still significant contributors to climate change even within a plant-based diet). 

<br><br>

Generally, any and all real issues within animal agriculture were greatly exaggerated by the film to the detriment of other very significant issues. For example, they used the figure that methane is ~80 times more potent than CO2, but this is only in the short term over 25 years. It is 28-36 times more potent over a 100 year period, still very significant, but not overwhelmingly so when considering other issues like proper refrigerants as Project Drawdown notes. With consideration to methane and manure, I did find the shrug-off of cows contribution as 'cow farts' to be infuriating. However, manure, when properly managed, can have a role to play as a natural fertilizer (where nitrogen fertilizers are a far bigger issue for soil health and water pollution) and part of the carbon cycle as a whole. The issue is the quantity and storage of it, another reason to still severely cut back meat consumption as a whole and switch to a largely plant-based diet. However, manure is not inherently bad, and the stats about manure covering several cities is mere shock value without substance. Additionally, the real issue is producing beef where it shouldn't be produced, i.e. cutting down tropical rainforest to produce beef (where only 1% of beef comes from anyways). There are vast swaths of the US and other parts of the world that are best suited not for plant agriculture, but for grazing. The plains of the US used to have many wild bison for good reason: there were an essential part of the ecosystem. However, the documentary is correct in noting that the scale in which we eat meat is not sustainable, and that many not-suitable ecosystems are ravaged, especially the predators, to make room for cattle. Grazing areas can be biodiverse as they once were, but this would ultimately require less meat eating. In addition, the rudimentary math done by the documentary was based on one particular stocking rate for one ranch for one kind of animal (when other animals could coexist in the same ranch). 
<br><br>


Finally, I want to talk about Allan Savory. What he did in Africa was indeed horrifying, but it does not mean his more recent research is immediately wrong. Savory has gone out of his way to disprove his old work and to ultimately Ishow that less animals on grazing lands is not good for the planet*. Ironically, Cowspiracy promotes less animals on grazing lands in any and all cases, which is the opposite extreme that may not actually help with desertification in the long run. You know who *I wouldn't trust to give ecological advice? A vegan dentist like Richard Oppenlander, or any of the 'experts' in Cowspiracy except for Lyman, who had extensive experience in the cattle/dairy industry.

Additional source - Many of the arguments against Cowspiracy were taken from this: https://www.quora.com/How-accurate-is-the-movie-Cowspiracy/answer/Karin-Lindquist
<br><br>
The main points where I differ from this person is how I still heavily emphasize a plant-based diet. I believe meat should not be consumed daily. While this person seems to assert that may still be possible, I think it's too unsustainable with the way human population is going. The main points I took were quantity vs quality of facts, benefits of managed grazing, and Allan Savory's new record.
<br><hr>
I'm so glad you brought this up since I was thinking the exact same thing. I do believe that eating a plant-based diet is essential to tackle the climate crisis, and is something that I practice in my life (and encourage my friends and family to practice as well). However, this film was extraordinarily off-putting and left me feeling enraged with Kipp. I think that blatantly lying about statistics to people is absolutely unacceptable. Lying about the facts is also much worse for Kipp's cause than acknowledging that his chosen problem is not as bad as he would lead us to believe. When I found out that Kipp was lying to his audience, I was enraged but I still am dedicated to the idea and practice of a plant-based diet. Unfortunately, I don't believe that everyone will have the same reaction. People who aren't as dedicated to solving the climate crisis or who are a bit unsure about whether they want to eat a plant based diet  may completely reject the benefits of a plant based diet because they were lied to. Because of this, I think that by lying to his audience, Kipp has done more harm than good. Surely there are other videos stressing the importance of a plant-based diet that the class could watch. 
<br><br>
The thing that enraged me the most about the film was how Kipp painted environmental organizations like cogs in the eco-killing status quo. They're not. Environmental organizations are doing fantastic work, and are doing better and more effective work than Kipp could even imagine doing himself. Kipp attempting to discredit environmental organizations is an insult to environmentalists and proves that Kipp cares more about his own vegan stardom than being eco friendly. If he wanted environmental organizations to focus more on veganism, he could have done so without the lies and slander that only serve to hurt the cause further. Kipp's hero complex (evidenced by the fact that he pretends to have solved global warming by being vegan, pretends to know more than anyone else, and traded in his bike for a gasoline guzzling van) is truly appalling and hurts the environmentally friendly cause.
<br><hr>
honestly before I saw your comment I believed everything in the video, as I'm sure most people did. Coming across your comment and it struck me that I could have been blinded to the film. While yes I think that eating largely plant-based will be extremely helpful, it will not be a saving grace. I appreciated the fact that you sited your sources, and from looking into them they seemed impressive, I was afraid they'd be mostly non-credible. It seems that all the numbers do not match up as you suggested. Which is honestly scary. At this point in time, I feel like every advocating party it attempting to sway people in their direction and using some false or exaggerated information. I feel like at this point all we know for sure is that the climate crisis is real and something needs to be done. So at this point, lets do all that suggests. Let's eat largely plant-based, lets bike to work, let's live sustainably. And lets stop arguing what the main cause is when we know what we're doing are causes.

People waste food so common that they take it for granted. Every day, we order plenty of dishes when we visit restaurants. What we all assume is that it should be enough for us to get full. However, we never really consider the consequences of the wasted food. Currently, I eat in the dining commons every day. Since it provides food that is “all-you-can-eat,” people get food without hesitation. Unconsciously, food will be wasted in the end. In my opinion, becoming a freegan is the best choice to environmentally make a change. If someone cannot be a full vegan, he or she has the choice to eat whatever one wants, as long as they can estimate the accurate number of carbon they emit from eating. In the film Cowspiracy, it talks about how large the amount of people emit carbon from eating beef, approximately 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Because cows need to provide beef, they contribute a huge amount of carbon emission to the environment that is impactful. And that’s why people start promoting the VEGAN option. These agricultural means lead to catastrophes that are difficult to be solved. As a result, I myself will start to adopt to be a freegan who actually can eat the exact amount of food I can consume without any unnecessary waste.

In the documentary Waste, the story of food waste, the director not only posted many causes of food waste, but also listed actions that were already taken by people to reduce food waste. Besides many common reasons, such as storage and tasteless part of food, the documentary mentioned the idea of expiration date. The food company gives their product a specific date, and people assume food is unsafe after that day. As a result, many food ends up in dumpsters. But this is not always true. Maybe we need to find a better definition to tell people whether the food should be dispose or not. 
<br><br>
People show their intelligence and creativity in handling food waste. I am impressed by the idea of using extra bread from sandwich company to make delicious beer. This is a win-win partnership: sandwich company does not need to deal with useless bread, while beer company safe money in raw materials. I also like the idea of introducing weighing machines in community. This is really useful for countries in East Asia because people there live in apartment. So it will be convenient to regulate the whole system. I believe the weighing system can help us waste less food because we will have a clear idea about the amount.

Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret is incredibly effective at communicating the message of animal agriculture as a powerful force in the destruction of our environment. It paints a picture of the large entrenchment of cattle pastures on forests, especially the Amazon, and of the corporate greed at the helm of the invasion. This comes across as impactful because viewers follow the journalistic trail of the filmmakers. You learn information along with the filmmakers. You seek answers just as the filmmakers seek answers. 
<br><br>

The film definitely affected me in the sense that it made me contemplate whether the way I consume meat is in line with much of my pro-environment values. Even though I have been trying to limit my meat consumption, it seems that it just is not enough. It has been easy to fall back into forgetting where my food is coming from and this film was an important reminder to be more conscious of the impact my food choices have.
<br><br>

The data is incredibly interesting to look at, and the interviews with some of the environmental groups avoiding the agriculture issue are especially suspicious. However, the fact that the filmmakers falsely claimed that animal agriculture accounts for 51% of greenhouse gas emissions when it was only 15% does take away from some of the impact of the film. This is because much of the urgency and emotional weight of the film depended on that huge statistic. Also, the filmmakers quietly correcting the number rather than admitting their mistake is disappointing. Despite this, however, I still have come to see animal agriculture as a major issue in greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation.

I definitely thought about my diet after watching the film. I'm a pretty big carnivores and I also come from a family of carnivores so it's harder for me to commit to reducing the amount of meat I consume. The longest I've been vegetarian was 2 week, but I feel like after watching this film I could try a bit harder at cutting meat out of my diet.


<br><hr>
The documentary cowspiracy was very informative in the impacts of animal agriculture on the climate crisis however there was also some descritable information which causes its message to be questionable. Nevertheless the fact that the meat industry accounts for a great majority of methane and co2 emission is a problem that needs addressing. If we use so much land for animal agriculture while disregarding its impact then the climate crisis will never be everted. Of course it is not realistic to cut out all meat from the average person's diet however even just limiting our consumptions can go a long way. I also get how you feel in terms of your own impact from dietary choices. It's hard to see any impact from myself not consuming any meat but change must happen somewhere. The fact of the matter is the only change that will happen is when people see a correlating negative impact. Other than that, many people's diets will continue to get worse and lean towards the fast and easy food that kills us slowly from the inside and out. Animal agriculture regulation is just as important as oil and fracking regulation or food waste regulation. In terms of the climate crisis, the main contributor is consumption and production. We have so much CO2 in the atmosphere because we literally consume things that produce CO2. Whether it be clothes, food, oil, or land if we don't regulate our usage of resources then there will continue to be a rise in unnecessary greenhouse gas emission.
<br><hr>
I agree that the method of us following the filmmakers as they seek answers is a great way to include and engage the audience as we are watching. I appreciated the effort they put into contacting these groups, exposing the ones that refused to talk or played the ignorance card, and in finding people who genuinely cared about the environment and what animal agriculture is doing to the planet. They put a lot of time and emotion into putting it together, and it does pay off.
<br><br>

It really did open my eyes again to what foods I am consuming, where they come from, and how disconnected most of us really are from our food. But I do agree that sometimes it really just doesn’t feel like I am doing enough. It gets tough to put in a conscious effort all of the time to think about where my food is coming from, what alternatives I can choose, and what suits my current lifestyle. But it's really just something that will take time and practice, and I do think it will get easier the more we get educated on the subject, and the more we think about what we are putting into our bodies.
<br><br>

I had the same problem with the filmmakers and their incorrect fact on how much emissions animal agriculture really does produce. They banked way too much of their message on some of those statistics, and they should have been upfront and forthright in saying they did not have accurate information. Their message still stands even if they were wrong in that statistic, but it does shine a bit of a negative light on them, especially when they wanted to expose all those companies who claimed to not know anything or wouldn’t talk to them. Overall though it was an impactful documentary filled with facts I had no idea about, such as the shooting of elephant herds (which was by far the most disturbing thing for me to witness, it did bring tears to my eyes), or Dorothy Mae Stang the nun who was murdered in the Amazon for trying to protect it. It just goes to show how deep these issues run, and how much we really need to do to take power away from massive companies, and how much we need to adjust our lifestyles.

Aubrey, I also enjoyed Kip Anderson’s film Cowspiracy and was blown away by the amount of new information that I had learned through this documentary. However I do have to admit that Kip mis-representing some of his information did undermine his film, especially the one figure he got wrong that animal agriculture accounts for 51% of greenhouse gasses when in reality it’s closer to 15%. I liked how Kip took the viewer along with him to make the same discoveries he was making at the time. I felt like I was a part of his team, seeking out big businesses and companies and trying to get them to tell the truth on certain issues like animal agriculture. I also think that this documentary is very revealing for those who eat meat on a regular basis. It makes a person conscious about what they’re putting into their bodies and what kind of effect it's having on the environment. I think one of the most interesting parts was how Kip reveals how no one wants to talk about animal agriculture and the greenhouse emissions that are tied in with this business. It’s like one big secret that all of these big corporations are in on, and they want to keep the public in the dark. I honestly believe that most people don’t even realize the kind of damaging effects that are being had on the environment because of raising animals to be eaten. And the worst part is the amount of this food that we don’t even eat, we just end up throwing it away or wasting it. It is truly amazing to me that we spend all of these resources, like feeding cows around 20 tons of food per week and not to mention all of the water they use up, just to eat red meat that's not very good for our personal health, and further destroy our bodies and the land around us simultaneously.

After watching the film “Wasted” I thought of my own experiences here at UCSB in regards to food waste. While I am very pleased with the small plated portions at all of the dining commons here on campus, I still watch people throw insane amounts of food away every day. I’ve even asked my friends why they waste so much food, and their answer is simply that they want to be able to try everything in case they don’t like it. I personally, would rather eat mediocre food than throw it away just to get something else, yet my friend’s argument is still valid. To be honest, the food in the dining halls just isn't good, or at least as good as it should be. By making better-tasting, healthier food, the food wasted on campus would significantly decrease and in the end, the school would save money. Or alternatively, the school could easily make cooking more accessible in the dorms. According to the film, cooking is a great way to reduce food waste. When you cook your own food, you feel more connected to it and are therefore less likely to waste it. Furthermore, the average college student lives on a tight budget, and is then less-inclined to buy any food that they won’t eat, or let anything that they do have go to waste. By improving the quality of the dining commons and making cooking more accessible, the school would dramatically reduce food waste. 
 <br><br>
In addition, I find it absolutely insane that 90% of wasted food ends up in the landfill, contributing to global warming, while there are multiple easy solutions to dealing with waste. We have the option to use wasted food to feed people, feed animals, generate energy, or compost. Why don’t we have any composting system on campus? It makes no sense to me. There should be a compost bin in every dining hall, and every resident hall. I’m sure that the school could put this compost to use in numerous ways. Wouldn’t it be cool if we had a garden on campus, where we grew food that could be used by dining halls. Or, the school could even sell the compost to local farmers who are always on the search for good, nutrient rich soil and fertilizers.

I think you make some really awesome points in your comment about how UCSB could greatly improve on their treatment of food waste. After all, we are widely known as an “environmentally friendly” campus and it would be nice if that was evident in the amount of waste we produce. I too have seen stacks of plates of food largely untouched being wasted and thrown away right here in our dining commons. I agree with what you said about the reason for all this waste being that people either don’t like the food they get or just want to “try different things”. I know you can’t satisfy everyone in the dining commons, but even then the school should at least provide some area in every dorm that incentivizes students to cook and prepare meals for themselves. For example, the “kitchen” area in my dorm is made up of a microwave and a sink in the laundry room. Although I consider myself to have moderate cooking skills, I don’t think even a professional chef could cook a full, healthy, inexpensive meal with the limited appliances provided.
 <br><br>
Another point you made which I thought was very thought provoking was that, at least to my knowledge, UCSB doesn’t compost all of this waste that is being produced by the dining commons. Sure, once you live off campus you can choose to compost and then it is your responsibility to eat more sustainably and waste less, but you don’t even get a choice to compost or eat more consciously when you live on campus. There should at least be a different area in the dining commons where you can separate between foods that can be composted and those that can’t, it’s what the students want and what he earth needs

<br><hr>

Yeah I agree. We waste a ton a food consciously and unconsciously. My roommate worked at Ortega and she would come back after the dinner shift and tell my other roommate and I about the amounts of food she had to dump to the trash. They do have composting bins at Ortega but the amounts of food that go to waste cannot go ignored. It would makes her sad and guilty because she along with most of the student population-including myself-  we struggle with food security but it was her job, she couldn't do anything. That's not easy thing to hear let alone see. However, I have been informed about UCSB implementing a plan to donate the leftover food to shelters but I haven't heard much on this. You are right we need to do more.
 <br><br>

The food served at the dinning commons doesn't suit my preference either but I don't know how they could make it taste better if taste is subjective. My version of the food tastes "great" is different from your friends "great". One thing I would like to point out is the food served at the dinning commons is "Americanized" which to me means bland. Hey, they do serve local grown veggies and fruit so that's a plus right?
 <br><br>
Also, we actually do have gardens on campus, the Urban Orchard at Stork Plaza, The Hydroponic Vertical Garden Project located between the MAC gym and the soccer fields, Student Farm on West Campus. There are programs where you could even start a garden plot with friends. If you want more info check these two websites out: https://www.sustainability.ucsb.edu/ediblecampus  http://food.ucsb.edu/gardens.

I agree. The movie “Waste” inspires me a lot. We all waste food unconsciously. There are many reasons for wasting food, such as being unpalatable, wanting to try many types of food, taking too much food, and even feeling bad today. But I don't think this is a reason we waste food. As you said, for example at UCSB, we have many ways to solve the problem of wasting food. Schools can improve the taste and quality of dishes, and students should monitor themselves. When we waste food, we should consider not only that we waste our food and cause the poor to not eat, but also that the food waste generated by it will eventually enter the landfill, and speed up the landfill. This is terrible.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that while it is so wasteful to throw away food that you do not like in the dining hall it is incredibly tempting because the food really is not for everyone. I am a pretty picky eater so I constantly find myself eating something that I do not actually enjoy because I do not want to just throw it away, and this film made my guilt even stronger. It can be really frustrating knowing that so much of our money is going towards a meal plan that offers us food that we do not actually want to eat. This is very much a first world problem and I acknowledge that, but I do think that with how much we pay we should be able to eat food that we do not want to waste. While I am glad that our dining hall does compost (This link has more information about our composting infrastructure here at UCSB https://recycling.as.ucsb.edu/composting/), I know that this is not the main solution to our problems as it is the fourth tier in the pyramid that was shown throughout the film. The first tier, which is feeding people, is obviously our goal. I really enjoyed your point that if the dining hall was to make more appealing dishes that we would produce less waste and that this would also be a more economical decision. I think that the economical side is what would be more convincing for those in charge of making such decisions because despite the environmentally conscious reputation that UCSB holds, most universities are more interested in finances than the well being of our planet. 

 <br><br>

In response to the idea of a campus garden, while it is pretty unknown The Department of Public Worms, A.S. Food Bank, and UCSB Sustainability have the Edible Campus Program (https://worms.as.ucsb.edu/edible-campus-program/)! The main problem right now is that not enough people are being informed about these great programs that our campus has to offer. Like the school shown in “Wasted” where the elementary school children are contributing to the composting of their own food scraps at school, we should all be more involved in the process. I think that we should also look into the second and third tiers that were mentioned in the film, feeding animals and creating renewable energy. While it may be far fetched for UCSB to have a set up like that of the Yoplait factory, we should work towards having more of a closed loop system with our energy. We are a research campus with very talented people so I would love to see what someone could come up with in terms of converting our food waste into energy. As you mentioned, Santa Barbara does have quite a few farms, so if we could look into feeding any of the farm’s animals that would be a great way to repurpose what we would typically waste. 
 <br><br>


Overall, as you mentioned, we have a lot of work to do as a campus and we definitely need to improve how our dining halls function. While UCSB may be one of the only campuses to meet the carbon neutrality goal of 2025, we should definitely be looking into how our food waste is contributing to our footprint.



<br><hr>
Like you I too began to think about the amount of food that is wasted here at the dining commons at UCSB. I do think that the no tray idea did make it easier to reduce the amount of food people were grabbing and yet I still find myself grabbing food that I am not eating. A big issue that a lot of the students here have complained about is how the food is not good. Honestly, it's true, sometimes the food there isn't ideal but there is no way for us to compost it. If there was a system implemented where the less food we compost then maybe we can get an extra entry into the dining commons. I really liked the initiative that the school in Massachusetts did where they taught the kids how to compost. When you ingrain something like that at such a young age, it grows with them and leads to a better future in the long run. Food scraps are honestly something that I never thought much about. I disposed of them not knowing how i was adding methane into the atmosphere by not composting it! It’s just crazy to me how much food is being wasted why some many people starve. I truly hope more people start taking their scraps and using them or at least composting them. It's amazing to see these chefs taking sustainability seriously while making it delicious.

While watching Conspiracy, I did question Anderson’s credibility. He described himself as a film maker, which initially made me question how he could contribute to exposing the agriculture industry if he does not have experience or knowledge within the industry. And now learning that his information was wrong, I question if his approach towards his interviews were of value. Since he was providing misinformation to his interviewees, how could they comment knowledgably on his questions and were their comments influenced by this misinformation. There’s a huge discrepancy between 51% and 15%. From the initial impression of the film, I questioned if what he was stating was true, but gave him the benefit of the doubt. and now after the fact, I realize the importance of checking the accuracy of information and that no source should be blindly trusted.
 
However, I did find value in his argument that eating less meat, or none at all, will greatly benefit the planet by reducing carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Like Ken said, this has to be a huge behavior change. I found it interesting in the film when Andersen was interviewing Guivetchi, who stated eating meat is a behavior change, yet also taking shorter showers and not watering your lawn is a behavior change. If communities are capable of reducing water consumption is those ways, then they should also be able to reduce water through changing their diet. People’s dependence on meat has been engrained in American culture for many years, I don’t exactly know how to change that, but a change needs to occur.

I agree learning that Anderson misinformed the viewers did make me think he was less credible. Although I still think the film was moving and made me want to give up eating meat. The film helped me understand and visualize how much damage we are creating by continuing consuming meat products. 
 <br><br>
However, I do not know how open I would be to becoming a freegan. While the concept is really interesting and seems to have a lot of benefits for the plant I still have concerns. I did not know that if one egg in a container was broken the whole thing would be discarded and facts like that do make me consider being freegan. 
 <br><br>
I also agree that we do need to come together to consume less meat because it would create a big change but I don’t know how soon we will all be able to do that. Since attending UCSB my meat intake has decreased and I think knowing the impacts of meat consumption can help people lessen their intake as well.





<br><hr>
As you mentioned, I also questioned Anderson’s credibility. When the film first started it seemed to me like he was just an average person who was mainly getting his sources from online which to me was already sort of a red flag. Not to take the climate change deniers side which I am in no way doing, but I do see why they have gained support. They will find anything to poke a hole in your argument and immediately call you an alarmist. They feed on these hiccups of misinformation and use it to their advantage to educate people and younger generations as a base of evidence. But although his argument was based on misinformation, he did bring up some good points about the affects of agriculture. Even though the problem isn’t a greater percentage that he had described (51% to 15%) it is still a problem worth acknowledging. 
 <br><br>

It was interesting to see how when Andersen was trying to contact certain climate change advocate organizations about the agriculture issue, they refused. That really left me wondering why they wouldn’t come out and talk about it; maybe they were hiding something. I agree with you that this whole agriculture problem is a behavior issue. The part where Andersen interviews the doctor in the film was a perfect example of this being a behavioral issue. The doctor was saying how in terms of consuming dairy products, it is not only unethical on the animal rights side, but also just unnatural for humans to be doing. Cows milk is meant for raising their baby calves. It’s growth fluid that we are purposely consuming and wondering why it comes with so many side effects. Why do you think people are lactose intolerant? Because it is obvious that cow’s milk isn’t something the human body should process (at least for some people). All in all, the film really provided insight on the non industrial side of climate change and how being self aware of food consumption can make all the difference as well.



<br><hr>
I don't think I could ever become a freegan either. Though it may be worthwhile for some, it's a bit too extreme for me. As Ken mentioned, it would be great if a program could be established to save food from being thrown out. One program in the San Francisco area, ExtraFood, collects excess food from grocery stores, schools, farmer's markets. They then deliver prepared food to those in need. Though it isn't really a solution to saving food like the 11 eggs among 1 broken one in the carton, the program is a good step to not only reduce waste, but also food insecurity.


<br><hr>>
I also agree with you about Anderson’s credibility since he didn’t even know the correct statistic between 15% and 51%. It seems like he was just doing research regarding animal global greenhouse emission but stumbled upon incorrect information regarding this issue. I understand that he is trying to educate the public through self-research but I think he should have done a better job on researching if he wanted to make a stronger statement. Although his credibility is questionable, I do admire his tenacity because it is hard to speak out against a huge industry that has a history of shutting people up by killing them. He does go out of his way to try and expose corporations that seem to speak out again climate change but focusing on another issue of climate change that has the same impact as animal emission. 
 <br><br>


What really made me think twice about eating meat was when one of the people who spoke out said even if you don’t eat meat once a week, you’re still contributing to animal emission and if you wanted to make a change, you would cut out meat entirely. I have always heard people going vegan for a day and you can reduce your carbon footprint by a lot but I never thought of it in that perspective which allowed me to understand that I still am part of the problem if I eat any meat in general. In addition, when Anderson interviewed the couple that owns a farm, they really said animals do not contribute to the carbon emission and if the land isn’t suitable for raising animals, they shouldn’t eat it. The United States is currently not suitable for raising even more cows and they still do it so I wanted to know if they know they are contradicting themselves because they said it with so much confidence and laughter. I wonder if they even know they are part of the problem with carbon emission or are they just ignoring the fact so they can profit from this industry.


<br><hr>

While watching Cowspiracy, I too was quick to question Anderson’s credibility. Later finding out after watching Ken’s video that his statics were not accurately stated, it makes me confused on why Anderson felt the need to make up a fake statistic when it is surely possible to make an environmental cause that is powerful and is in opposition of the meat and dairy industry. The film is also filled with many other facts that are true and explain the true environmental damage and deforestation caused by animal agriculture. However, there is another problem I found with this film which is that the film believed the best way to save the world was to solely change to a vegan-based diet. Although, this is one step to further saving our world it is not what is going to only save it if we only make this one transition. To make large impactful changes worldwide, we need serious political pressures to form a global movement for sustainability. By just buying more “eco-friendly,” products or cutting out the meat of our diets just is not going to make that happen. 
 <br><br>

It is not wrong to go vegan, but people need to realize that this alone is not going to make a significant change, which is what this film fails to explain. There needs to be a larger emphasis on the groups and institutions out there that are focusing pushing for action on the issue and are challenging the mass meat and dairy consumption in industrialized nations. I think it is important for people to understand that we need to come together as one in trying to find ways that support several causes and act on these problems together rather than trying to point out a single cause.
<br><hr>
I can't help but be slightly annoyed that Anderson was so incredible throughout the whole film. The entire time I was annoyed with his attitude and his interviews embarrassing the interviewees with his false statistics and unwillingness to see any other viewpoint beside his agriculture argument. I was in the same frame of mind that you and many other viewers were that I would give him the benefit of the doubt, but as you stated we are too quick to trust. I appreciate the message that he is trying to get across but I am unfortunately disappointed in his delivery and I'm turned off by his false statistics.

This movie hit really close to home as my hometown is a very agricultural society. Many of my friends’ families own small organic dairies and cattle companies that they rely on for their main source of income. Growing up, I always thought that these types of dairy and beef farms were much better for our environment and health compared to mega factory farms. After watching this film, I have found out that is a large misconception. It turns out the large-scale factory farms are actually more sustainable than small, family owned, grass fed dairies. To me this is a very sticky issue. On one hand, I want to do what is best for our environment and decrease my ecological footprint as much as possible, but on the other hand I would much rather eat beef and drink milk from cows that are organically grass fed compared to feed fed. Ethically I do not want to support mega farms that cram thousands of cows into small amounts of space and feed their cows the cheapest feed they can. I do not think the small-scale local farmers should be discouraged from continuing to raise and sell livestock. I think we need to turn away from factory farms by buying beef and milk locally as much as possible. Although the small-scale farms may be less environmentally conscious, factory farms are no doubt the perpetrator in deforestation around the world. Small family farms do not have sufficient funds to purchase large plots of land to turn into cattle grazing land. Factory farm owners do. If a large enough emphasis is placed on local, organic meat and dairy, I think these mega farms will start to lose money and be unable to continue expanding by clearing rainforest and habitats.
 <br><br>

An even better solution to this problem is to boycott dairy all together and strive to use dairy alternatives. There are countless dairy substitutes available in grocery stores and restaurants making it a very easy transition. Starbucks has recently acknowledged that the dairy industry is a leading contributor to climate change and is working to incorporate more vegan options into their franchise. I believe this is a huge step in the right direction. Starbucks is probably one of the most popular coffee chains in the entire world. They have stores on almost every block and on every continent. Therefore, if they set a standard for utilizing dairy alternatives, regular customers are going to become accustomed to that and other companies are going to follow suit as well. The more people that incorporate dairy alternatives into their daily lives is going to lessen the demand for cow's milk and lead to more sustainability.

I think that there is a big misconception that factory farms and unsustainable farms are more sustainable than actual sustainable farms just because they use less land. Yes, less space means less deforestation. However, they still pollute the environment. They use pesticides and antibiotics in their crops and animals, which seep into the ground and into the water, ruining the environment and making them more likely to find newer land to ruin and the cycle never ends. Sustainable farms, on the other hand, might use more land but they use much less water, no pesticides, no antibiotics, and therefore they don't pollute the environment. In fact, they preserve the fertility of the soil so that they don't have to find new land. They also use food waste as fertilizer, and food waste is #3 on the project drawdown list! I also believe that when people choose to buy from sustainable farms, they are also engaging their ethics. They are the same people who eat animal products more responsibly and are more likely to fall into the habit of buying less meat.

I understand how you felt because the documentary also hit close to me. “Fishless oceans by 2048”. This struck me since I am from Monterey Bay, where marine life is one of the major tourist attractions, especially the Monterey Bay aquarium. When you walk out of the aquarium, there is a street full of restaurants that serve seafood and a majority claim to fish sustainably. It was sad to hear the reality from Dr. Oppenlader that the Monterey Bay fisheries are being exploited. Compared to the other lectures, this one impacts me the most because I love eating sushi and eating Tuna salads. 
 <br><br>

I think your idea of boycotting the dairy industry would make a major impact. Dairy may be a little easier but encouraging everyone to stop consuming meat will be extremely hard. I thought about how much the fossil fuel industries are blamed for the greenhouse gases and what a difference it could make if they all worked together to turn on the agriculture industry and show the public the truth. Not that these industries are any better but maybe that will help open everyone's eyes to the harsh reality. This industry is responsible for deforestation to ocean dead zones and the majority of the public are unaware.

I have been on a plant-based diet for 5 years now. When I first announced to my parents my decision, they plain told me "don't do that". In the beginning it was weird, but around the 6-month to 1 year mark they started realizing that this was here to stay, and started embracing it. My conviction that what I was doing correct, and how much I was enjoying it aroused the interest of all my friends. 1 of them became vegan, and another 2 started following predominantly plant-based diets. The consumption of animal products to me has 4 detrimental effects that are, in the order of importance: 1. Environmental: animal products harm and pollute the environment. 2. Ethical: the animal food economy has produced a supply chain of merciless death and pain. 3. Health: consuming animal products has been proven to be detrimental to health. 4: Societal: the notion of the endless production and consumption of animal products in such a blatant way is a form of toxic consumerism and has a detrimental effect on humans as a society and species.
 <br><br>

I have been taking tests every year since I started following a plant-only diet out of curiosity and as a sorts of experiment. My health has been improving each year, all my vital signs and blood tests are great, and I have an incredibly low bad cholesterol - the factor that kills the most people by far through heart attacks and stroke. Go plant-based people!

This is so encouraging to read. Although I am not yet entirely plant based, I have been vegetarian and mostly dairy free for 6 years. I've also found that many of my friends have taken on the same lifestyle, which is the best feeling. I had the same experience with my family, because they are all set on eating meat and not changing their diets, but I found that I've been able to at least convince them to eat less meat or go meatless for one day a week. So many people tell they could never give up meat or don't understand how I "survive" without it, and those types of comments used to always irritate me because I see the problem of animal agriculture as a problem much bigger than my own wants. However, I now try to encourage people to just try it, one day at a time. I tell people about how they eat so many vegan or vegetarian foods a day, and just don't think about it. I also try to encourage them to go without meat or animal products for just a day or so a week, or try phasing out animal products slowly. I love how you mention your health, because so many people try to act like they're suddenly nutritionists when you tell them you don't eat animal products. Regardless, I'm motivated to go completely plant-based, and watching the documentary was just a reminder of how awful the animal agriculture industry is.

It is really impressive! I feel I am encouraged after knowing your experiences of eating locally planted food. I am a vegetarian. Some of my friends usually make fun of me for being vegetarian. They think eating vegetables all the time means no protein and fat. Actually, vegetables, like avocado, are sources of healthy fat. I also eat some fish and eggs to keep I have enough protein. I did not have any health problems, and eating less meat also makes my digestive system better.

There’s a lot more to the climate crisis than environmental innovation. Leading environmental awareness foundations have to approach sustainability like a business: convince consumers to buy into the product by making the product seem desirable and easy to acquire and consume. Persuading consumers to care and maintaining an ethical, purely environmentally focused foundation is a nearly possible line to balance on, in my opinion. This, I believe, is a big reason as to why the detrimental effects of the agriculture industry are not brought to more attention. And while the Cowspiracy documentary overinflated and dramaticized statistics surrounding sustainability, his point is made clear when he approaches various businesses and groups that affect and are affected by climate change. What surprises me, however, is the reactions many faces surrounding sustainability had in the Cowspiracy documentary. They ignored, denied, and dismissed these easily understood facts like children. 

 <br><br>

What separates sustainability such as changing light bulbs or recycling from veganism and all its variations, in my opinion,  is the fact that people are simply more attached to food. Sure, it is easy to request for a person to carpool to work, but to give up their grandma’s christmas roast recipe? Now that’s a different story. It’s because we as humans have created an emotional connection with food. It’s not the meat we’re after, it’s the feeling that it evokes; what we eat is a part of who we are and what we came from. Which is why shifting society’s mindset to encompass more earth friendly diets into their lives is a challenge.

The film “Cowspiracy” taught me that animal agriculture is the number one contributor to climate change. Before this documentary, I was unaware that livestock was the leading cause of resource consumption and environmental degradation. Cows are the reason for fishless oceans, animal extinction, and forest cut downs. All the methane produced by a cow’s digestive system is insane. This is the first time I have come across this film but I have watched a couple other documentaries on this topic and because of this, I have decided to incorporate more veggies in my diet and consume less meat. The meat I do consume is chicken and turkey rather than beef and pork. I have also cut dairy out of my life and switched over to vegan yogurt and almond milk. I know that my individual contribution will go a long way in the journey to save our planet. 
 <br><br>

I feel optimistic about the future. I know that a lot of people care about the environment and are really out here trying to make a difference. There are those who clean up oceans as well as those who completely cut meat out of their lives. Although this is a big issue that has been covered up for many years by the government, environmental organizations, and the meat and dairy industry; people can now see the truth and act on it.

After viewing this film and your comment. I think your comment is persuasive and I agree with you with the bottom of my heart. In my opinion, animal agriculture is one of the biggest problems for our environment. Animals don't release that much carbon dioxide, but they produce different kinds of trash for the environment. And due to the fact that people sold millions and thousands tons of  meat in the market, animal agriculture would never actually end as the demand in the market exists. But they really create tons of trash for us, everyday people have to deal with their feces. Also, they can cause serious problems to the natural world because they are well protected, there is no predator that can threaten them. So they can reproduce and find food without worries. The goats are a good example, they only eat the root of the grass, so there will be no grass on this piece of land next year. Usually, the wolves would control the number of goats, as the wolves are gone, goats start to reproduce without the threats of wolves. They cause many damages to our environment.

I had a similar experience to yours after watching this film. I was in complete shock after realizing how much damage the livestock and the fishing industry has on the planet. One jarring revelation was when it was explained that both fracking and the beef industry had the same amount of methane emission, but the water consumption for the beef industry was much larger. Often times when we think of the detriment that we cause on the Earth our mind goes to CO2 or methane emissions, but we fail to include the waste of resources. As mentioned in the film land that was once abundant in flora and fauna are being taken over by these livestock industries in order to keep up with the demand  of our everyday lifestyles. Coming from a rural area where agriculture is a crucial factor in our economy, dairies and farms litter a lot land that once was used for the farming of vegetation. We see the cows being treated unfairly and the large amount of potential of the neighboring land, but is considered undesirable because of the livestock industry.
 <br><br>


I thought it was extremely frustrating that we are marketed to help the environment with our day-to-day habits and for it to only be 5% of the water usage in the United States. As the film states 55% is utilized on animal agriculture. We are often told that our habits are what driving the Earth's environment to the ground when in reality it majorly influenced by large corporation. This is not to say we should not continue to change our domestic habits for the better, but we should also consider targeting these corporations. This is why it is incredibly important to vote and realize that our dollar is worth more than monetary value. Our dollar steers the way for accessibility and production of more environmentally-friendly options that will lead to a better future for upcoming generations.

I totally agree with you, Cowspiracy is definitely a game changer for the climate crisis. I remember walking into one of my friend’s rooms around a few months ago and the first thing he said was “have you watched Cowspiracy?” At the time, I hadn’t known what the film was about, but was interested in the impact that it had when the rest of my friends watched it and decided to participate in “Green Monday,” basically not eating meat every Monday. As stated in my previous comments, I have become a vegetarian since coming to UCSB and have tried to reduce my animal product intake since learning about the massive impacts that methane emitted from cows has on the environment. 
 <br><br>
One part of the film that I found most interesting focused on the effects of rainforest deforestation. I was surprised when the film stated that around one hundred species are lost a day due to rainforest deforestation. The animal agricultural industry destroys forests in order to create more space for cattle, however more cattle means more methane emissions as well as overgrazing. I think that it is important that we take steps to reduce our intake of animal products, especially beef, in our own lives. The expense of raising cattle and producing the meat that we see in markets outweighs the benefits that we get from consuming meat.

I too was amazed when I saw that livestock were the greatest contributor to climate change and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Like the narrator in the beginning of the film, I thought that fossil fuels were the most detrimental to our environment and I they were the first thing I thought of when I thought of climate change.While I knew that livestock was the cause of much deforestation (to make room for the animals to graze), I had not known that they were also responsible for the lack of fish in our oceans, I had (for some reason) assumed that the damage of livestock was limited to on-land problems. Looking back at this idea, I realize it is rather ridiculous as if livestock contributes to greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming, which acidifies our oceans, then of course livestock would have a detrimental effect on ocean creatures → everything that pollutes has a detrimental effect on every aspect of life on earth. Overall, I really enjoyed the film The Cowspiracy, it makes me want to rethink my current diet so I consume fewer animal products and contribute less to the pollution created by raising livestock.


<br><hr>
I was also unaware that animal agriculture was one of the leading contributors to climate change, but after watching this documentary, it makes sense why it has such a large impact. Raising livestock requires an insane amount of resources- 55% of domestic water use geared towards this! I was shocked that I was unaware of this information until Kip Anderson exposed how many environmentalist organizations were quiet regarding animal agriculture. The lack of media coverage and general public awareness about the consequences of eating meat/animal products is extremely dangerous, in my opinion. I respect your efforts to eat less meat, and I know a lot of people who have also stopped eating meat, but for health-related reasons or because of animal cruelty. Environmental concerns could also be a major influence if more people were educated about the deforestation, carbon emissions, and other repercussions that result from animal agriculture, and some would be more likely to reduce their consumption of animal products. Therefore, for the most part, I believe this was an important and powerful documentary. However, I was off-put by the fact that the statistic stating animal agriculture is responsible for 51% of greenhouse gas emissions was actually inaccurate. It makes me wonder if this was purposeful in order to generate more urgency for action or if Anderson actually believed this information was true.

I agree that "Cowspiracy" did a good job of connecting cow agriculture with other environmental detriments that many people had no suspicions of being connected with the practice, however I do not feel as optimistic as you do when it comes to change coming about. I completely agree that there is a fast sweeping movement to convert to plant based diets in this country, but not enough people are getting on board. I was a vegan and strictly stuck to my diet for a while until I became too malnourished to make it through the day without needing a 3-5 hour nap. Protein options for vegans are expensive, and extremely sparse here at the UCSB dining halls. We are provided with plain tofu, and when it is occasionally put in another dish, there is only a couple cubes of tofu put in. My point is, being vegan was no longer doable for me and my circumstances. I started to eat chicken and turkey more often and some cheese on occasion. I never liked beef in the first place, so that does stay out of my diet, even when it is the main protein option I have for dinner. Veganism is difficult and not something everybody can maintain. I am aware that in other countries, like India for example, most food is mainly vegetarian or vegan and living such a lifestyle is not expensive or difficult. Here in the states, the "trend" of being vegan is capitalized upon by high end grocery stores and companies selling "whole foods" and makes good vegan food so pricey. And yes, there is "cheap" vegan food we can all eat like canned beans, vegetables, rice etc. but in order to incentivize people to switch the food has to be more varied and similar to a non-vegan diet. Although it very well can be, it is usually very expensive this way.

I remember watching cowspiracy back in 7th grade, but to be honest, back then I didn’t pay attention to the film and didn’t find any sense of urgency in the message that the filmmakers were trying to make. To me, my mom had never let me consume beef, so I didn’t really think I had much to gain from the film. It always frustrates me when the films or readings focus on the faults of organisations. It makes me feel completely helpless, because I just don’t know what would make them actually start to care about something other than personal and economic gain. And whilst I understand that this film focuses a lot on the perspectives of the organizations, I will never understand why it is so hard for people to cut their red meat consumption, especially because I’ve been doing it my whole life. It just blows my mind. I’m personally not a vegetarian, but I try my hardest, and have been successful, in not consuming red meat. Yes, it was due to religious reasons that my mom passed onto me, but it still gives the same effects.  I wish that this didn’t annoy me as much as it did, because honestly it was hard to pay attention to the documentary because this was on my mind the whole time. And on top of that Kip Anderson just seemed whiny the whole time, it was just really difficult for me to resonate with him. At this point, I just get frustrated when someone mentions trying to move away from beef, because it’s not that hard.

I knew that vegetarianism and veganism were beneficial for the animals involved but I had no idea about the immensely positive environmental and personal impacts it has. Kip Andersen takes us on an eye-opening journey that he experiences with us in Cowspiracy. We uncover another industry all about the money. Animal agriculture has become central to our economy and therefore many people, especially Americans, became comfortable with meat-heavy eating habits. So now neither the money makers nor the people want to make change, even if the industry is causing environmental devastation. It was fascinating to discover how much energy and materials it takes to produce only one pound of meat. It takes so much water, land, and feed for the us to use animals to produce meat or dairy. We are mass breeding these animals which means more carbon dioxide and methane distributed into the atmosphere, and additionally cutting down incredible amounts of trees to clear land which decreases oxygen output. It was astonishing to learn about how awful the process of meat and dairy production is for our climate and then to find there are so many other poor side effects. The animals are suffering in horrible conditions and with such a short time on Earth, predators are killed to make room for livestock, and of course the issue of so much water and land wasted. 
 <br><br>

It was disappointing to learn that Kip based much of his journey on inaccurate facts. It is still an extremely impactful and important film, but it was hard to hear after how worked up I was and how much I trusted Kip’s knowledge and only to learn it is in fact not the main contributor to climate change. It did make the film more dramatic, but I am not sure how to react now that I learned I was presented with wrong information.

“You either live for something or die for nothing”. After watching “Cowspiracy”, this quote from the film stuck out to me. I was shocked when learning about how significant the agricultural business is to the issue of climate change. Learning that one pound of beef takes 2500 gallons of water was insane to me. I often eat meat without realizing how much water it takes, how much forest degradation occurs because of it, or how much greenhouse gases it emits. I saw many similarities to the film and real life, as people constantly avoid the issue of agriculture. I had no idea that people have been killed because of speaking out, I was astounded. This film deeply disturbed me, as I saw how animals are truly treated. It was disappointing to learn that sustainable farming does not fully exist. As I learned how much methane cows produce and how much land they require, I felt a little hopeless. The agricultural business commits heinous crimes, ruining the environment and animals. 
  <br><br>

I was extremely confused to learn that the Kip used the wrong statistics in the film. As a viewer, I believe this harms his credibility. The issue of animal agricultural is a big enough problem that it could have been taken seriously without having misleading statistics. I was very moved by the film and decided to go back to being vegetarian. I plan to ultimately become vegan, while also transitioning to using less plastic. Even with the wrong statistics, I was very motivated by the film to make a difference. Many people don’t realize how drastically the agricultural business is hurting the environment. I wish that young people throughout college would have to see this film, as it serves as a good reminder to shop and eat responsibly. We must practice what we preach and take a stand environmentally. I learned that 75% of Americans believe they are environmentalists, yet we are still facing this issue. I hope that classes such as this one can draw attention to the issue. We cannot say we care for the earth if we continue to eat meat and turn a blind eye to the massive amount of destruction occurring.

Similarly, the misstatement of the statistic regarding the global greenhouse emission of animal agriculture made me question the credibility of the documentary and the other facts used as the difference between 51% and 15% is massive. When Ken pointed this out, it made me question if this was possibly why some of the people he interviewed may have disregarded it or questioned the statistic; however, either way, it doesn’t hide the fact that animal agriculture is a major factor in emission and doesn’t disregard environmental organizations reasons for not being able to publicly discuss it and present it on their websites. The statistic of 1,100 activists killed over the last 20 years in Brazil for speaking out about cattle ranch and the animal industry was surprising to me and seemed to provide an explanation for why people may not address it, but it still made me question its position of authority in America.
  <br><br>

Ultimately, the focus of Cowspiracy on the significance of plant diet for reduces emissions, better effect for the environment, and individual benefits health-wise touched me the most as I mentioned before that I am considering a plant-based diet. Along with such a transition by dietary standards, the other outcomes that would come with a move away from such an emphasis on the animal industry would be benefits for others in the world, especially low-income populations in need as it was stated that we obviously have enough food to feed every single human on this planet and yet we feed it off to the animals while people are starving and dying. This is a test against humanity with the fact that we are disregarding the health of others in order to live in such a privileged society that lives off the labor and suffering of others as our capitalist society and consumer culture has allowed us to enjoy such a variety of foods. Again, this comes down to the capability of Americans and individuals worldwide to make a change of behavior in order to be selfless and open their perspective towards overall improvement and security of our future and the planet’s future.


<br><hr>
The documentary "Cowspiracy" reveals the true cost behind the food we eat. Like you, I know that cattle breeding harms the environment but I never know how much cost it takes exactly. I am astonished about the "secret cost" behind food. Now, each time I eat the beef, I will think about the resources that used to raise it, so I choose to eat meat as less as possible. Changing personal eating habit seems easy and is often overlooked by the public. People always think climate change as a global and grand issue, which is true but only partly true. Because climate change can also be small and personal issue for everyone. It is related to our daily lives, so don't only depend on Government to solve the problem since there are many things we can do to change the situation. Changing diet is a tiny action but can lead to great changes overall. Another fact that 1/3 to 1/2 food is wasted in the world remind me of the story in my country. Decades ago, the phenomenon of wasting food is popular in the society due to cultural reason. People order food that is far beyond the amount they can eat when dining together, because ordering more food can show hospitality of inviters. If the food is not enough, inviters will loss face. As a result, almost half of the food is wasted in every feast.  Fortunately, more and more people realize the problem and damage behind this bad culture, eventually, the government prohibit such behaviors and encourage people to order what they need and eat all they ordered.

The statistics presented in “Cowspiracy” really blew my mind, and it really baffled me. I didn’t realize the agriculture business had such a huge and negative impact on the earth. However, after watching this, I realized that my lack of knowledge wasn’t my fault. The amount of information that is hidden from the public about the harm the agriculture business does is tremendous, and the lengths they go to protect it gives me chills. When Greenpeace and other non profit organizations wouldn’t say if they took donations from these big agriculture businesses, and refused to put it as the number one cause of emissions, I got scared. This is when I realized the extent of the information they kept hidden, and made me see just how much control they have over the information provided to the information. The senseless deaths of the activists rooting for the amazon rainforest also shocked me, because they were just speaking the truth, and this just shows how far they are willing to go to silence any opposition. 
   <br><br>
Seeing this movie also made me see how eating animals just isn’t sustainable in the future. Cows drink 45 billion gallons of water and 135 billion lbs of food, which is a significantly bigger amount than us. With the amount of resources they need to sustain themselves, humans are much better off conserving the earth for future generations and sacrificing meat as part of our diet. After watching this, I looked into going vegetarian, and going to try next week. It’s going to be very difficult for me, but it will be worth it once I see the statistics from this long term decision.

I, too, was blown away by the statistics in "Cowspiracy" and by how much information is hidden from the public. Their lack of willingness to comment on livestock's impact on the environment only reinforced the notion that there is some dirty dealing within these organizations. While it is indisputable that livestock is a leading cause of climate change, I felt this film portrayed this issue in a very black and white matter when in reality it is far from. There are many nuances that go into this industry and for many its not so easy as just going vegetarian. In numerous developing countries, hundreds of thousands of families' livelihoods depend on the animal husbandry and farming business. I just felt this film could've incorporated more of a complete view of this industry, both its ramifications and its reasons. Aside from that, this film brought to light many frightening facts about the livestock business and really succeeded in driving home the imperative need for change in this industry and in our personal consumption habits.


<br><hr>
The point you made saying the amount of information to the public is hidden about the negative impacts of agriculture is a great example. I believe these companies put out information that we want to hear so we can keep supporting them when in reality we are supporting major co2 emitters. I also agree with your point of continuing to eat meat in the future is almost impossible to sustain. I think this documentary does a really good job of showing the bad sides of eating meat now and what will happen if we continue to eat meat. This documentary really inspires the watchers to at least try being vegetarian for a week, and if you like it you can continue. The biggest part that made me want to try a vegetarian diet was losing my support of buying meat from these big companies. The fact that will do anything to protect their business is disgusting and I no longer want to support them.




<br><hr>
I agree with you in that it is not our own fault for being uneducated about this subject of how livestock is raised to produce the meat that we consume but rather the fault of green organizations not willing to disclose this information even though it is very important. We as consumers can only do so much research to find out about where all of the things we buy come from. In addition, when these kinds of statistics and facts are hidden from us, it makes it close to impossible to find out what was shown in Cowspiracy. I agree with the guy, Kip, in the film that it is disheartening to see green companies to not disclose some information or to disregard just what kind of damage that agriculture, specifically with livestock, is doing to our plant. How could someone consider themselves to be a green advocate and activist if they are not willing to point out all of our problems. However, I do not agree with Kip when he was mad that not every group was plastering agriculture on their sites because not every activist organization is directed toward that part. Yes agriculture is a problem on our planet however, some groups may choose to focus more on rainforests or the ocean and that is perfectly okay. Those groups did not deserve to be bashed on for not pointing out a problem that was not a part of their focus in the first place. Also, Ken stated that our wasting of food is a bigger problem that could be turned around on to Kip. We could ask why he was not focusing on food waste when it is such a large problem and we would be doing exactly what he was doing in his film to some of the organizations. I enjoyed that this film does convey the problem of how we are growing livestock but I do not enjoy the mood of accusatory very much. But that’s just my opinion.

When I heard the narrator in “Cowspiracy” say that 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock I was a bit skeptical, but since it was said in a very successful documentary, I felt it had to be true. It wasn’t until I watched Ken’s video that I learned that was it is only 15%. This was a bit disappointing to me because we shouldn’t be giving climate change deniers anything to use against us. The message behind this documentary is amazing, and it made me even better about my decision to go vegan. However, I do think that the narrator or the filmmakers should have fact-checked their information before they put it out into the world. Something that the film brought up that I never really think about is the fact that the animals we are eating were at some point alive. A piece of steak on your plate doesn’t exactly look the same as a living cow, so it's easy to forget what you are eating. The scene where the man cut off the duck's neck was heartbreaking to me, I could barely watch it. “Cowspiracy” reminds me of a lot of the movie “Food Inc.” which I watched in environmental science. In “Food Inc.” it was explained how almost all of the people that work for the food sector of the government, mostly the FDA, are former employees of big food companies. When the government officials that were interviewed in “Cowspiracy” were extremely apprehensive to say anything about the food industry, I started to wonder if they too were being controlled by these big food companies. The most disgusting part of this documentary is the fact that hundreds of people have been killed by these companies for simply exposing the harm they are causing on the environment. This reminds me of how many scientists who have found groundbreaking cures for cancer have been found dead just weeks after their discovery was made. We like to think we live in a free country, but we are just pawns in a much bigger game controlled by those with money and power.

When I was watching Cowspiracy, I had the same reaction as you when Kip explained that 51% of greenhouse emissions come from livestock. I was skeptical about the figure at first, but as the documentary went on, I accepted the number because it seemed like it was coming from a credible source. I feel that it is slightly disappointing finding out that the narrator was wrong because we need to get as many people as possible to believe in climate change, and it will be difficult to do so if someone is publishing incorrect facts about the topic. It also made me wonder if the other data in the film was false. Does it actually take 660 million gallons of water to produce one hamburger or is that incorrect as well? It is unfortunate to see that one wrong statement has created so much doubt. 
   <br><br>


On the other hand, I do believe that the documentary brings up important points that must be addressed around the world. I also wondered why government officials were hesitant to talk/be interviewed about livestock's contribution to the climate crisis. There has to be some reason -- good or bad -- for these people who claim to care about the environment to not speak up about the growing issue of livestock and its emissions. Additionally, I cannot believe that people have been killed over this topic. The controversy spreading around the agriculture industry should never be motive enough to kill. Sister Dorothy Stang should never have given her life for the sole reason that she spoke out against the industry. Even if you do not think the climate crisis is a real event that is happening right now, you should at least be furious about the fact that the agriculture companies are able to get away with this kind of violence.


<br><hr>

 It's insane that these companies are committing murder and getting away with it. If you found out that the CEO of your favorite clothing company murdered the CEO of their rival company, wouldn't you be hesitant to buy from that company ever again? Because food companies are not a "brand" its hard to know where your food is really coming from. A couple of food companies own the vast majority of all food in supermarkets, and every time you go to the grocery store and buy anything you are probably supporting one of these huge companies without even knowing. This is how these companies are staying sort of anonymous. In addition to this nobody knows that people are getting murdered over this issue in the first place. How are these companies not going to prison? The government controls the legal system and these food companies are intertwined with these food companies in every way, so it kind of makes sense. That's also why nobody is hearing about these murders. We as consumers have so much more power than we believe, we can buy or not buy whatever food we want, to an extent. Even changing the type of meat you buy can make a huge difference.
<br><hr>


The false percentages also made me skeptical about the movie. It made me look at his ultimate solution to be quite lackluster in solving the climate crisis. I think we should look at the true perpetrators of climate change, the greedy industries that have way too much power/money. It scares me that they're able to influence activist groups, whose whole purpose was to go against these businesses. 
   <br><br>
Adding on to other alternatives to fight the climate crisis in the cow industry, he made it seem as if the only way to change the industry is to convert all production to grass grazing ranches. To him, there was no other alternative since this one would result in needing more land than we have to provide these cows with grass grazing. With new technology, we found that synthetic meat could be procured in a lab. I see this to be an outstanding solution to the crisis if we are able to convert the way meat is made to this method. This is all speculation, of course, and I'm sure during the time of filming this documentary, the advancement had not been made yet. 
   <br><br>
I'm glad he brought to light a major contributor to climate change, I remember this film when it first came out to have such a controversial response. It's crazy to think that some of the problems of our world may have been censored just because a group of individuals has the resources to do so. In all, I feel like it brings us a step closer to solving this crisis.

The documentary Cowspiracy is really a powerful film that exposes the hidden truth of climate change: animal agriculture. Before watching this documentary, it had never occurred to me that eating dairy products and meat in my daily meals would have such detrimental impacts on our environment. Although I knew that it is recommended for people to switch to a largely plant-based diet in order to benefit the planet, I had never thought that simply including meat in our daily meals would leave such an enormous carbon footprint on our environment. I do not eat much meat per day as the only types of meat that I eat are fish, chicken, and occasionally beef, but I do love eggs and I eat eggs every morning during breakfast. Eggs to me become an inseparable part of my breakfast routine. To be perfectly honest, I would not be used to eating breakfast without eggs. However, after watching this documentary, I realized that even the simplest dairy products such as eggs are still contributing much to the damages to our planet by worsening the climate crisis, and it is time for me to make better and more environmentally-conscious breakfast choices from now on. This documentary is really educational because it reveals animal agriculture to be a major factor in causing the climate crisis, yet nobody-not even the environmental activist groups- is willing to address it due to the strong political and economic powers of the agriculture industry. This industry has pretty much bought their way into the environmental organizations by lobbying them with money and other forms of financial support to ensure that their business would still be running. That is why we see those environmental organizations advocating people to abandon car usage and condemning the use of fossil fuels while the entire sector of animal agriculture is entirely ignored by those organizations and consequently the public remains in oblivion towards this field. 
   <br><br>


One point during the film that really triggered me was on the topic of overfishing. When the Oceana representative used an example of banking interest to compare it to the fishing industry justifying the action of overfishing that more fish would be naturally produced every year and we just need to take them like the bank takes its investors’ interests, and that the way to help the fish populations to grow is to fish more. This response really angered me because this is utter nonsense and this is disrespectful towards our marine environment because it is common sense to stop or reduce the practice of fishing in the place in order to mitigate the issue of overfishing. This example really goes to show how ignorant even some of those so-called environmental organization watch groups are and how that they are still operating on the financial interests of the animal agriculture and fishing industry and that they never really cared much about our environment. Just like the film states, those environmental watch groups are literally just “watch groups” who watch the planet and its animal species being depleted and extinct without taking any necessary measures or action to address and help their survival. This example even made me lose a bit of hope in the environmental organizations because they are not doing what they are claiming and are supposed to do; they are still weighing the interests of businesses over the overall health and ecological balance of our planet.

If I were to rate Cowspiracy I would definitely give it a 10 out of 10 because it is such an eye-opening film that everyone should watch it for them to gain a more thorough and realistic comprehension of the current conditions of our environment and what central causes led the planet to the way it is today. I would also recommend this film to others because it addresses the shocking and ugly truth of our regular meat-heavy diet and that if we want to save our planet, we need to significantly reduce or cut down the amount of meat consumption as well as the large amount of food we waste everyday.

I was also shocked by the real impact of animal agriculture. After watching this film, I feel the earth is under a tremendous potential danger. I can't believe the true cost behind the meat I consumed every day, but I have to admit. And, I feel the difficulty behind solving this problem. It is not possible to make all people stop eating meat in a short time. And, the impact behind shut down all animal agriculture is tremendous. Therefore, I think the government now should face this issue now and start to lead people to change instead of using their invisible hand to cover the truth. 
   <br><br>
From this film, I learn the fact that animal agriculture is harming our world in a potential way. And, I start to feel a little bit guilty when I eat the meat.  In solving the problem of animal agriculture, I feel pessimistic, because animal agriculture has already become part of everyone's life now. It is hard to prohibit people from eating meat in a short period of time.
   <br><br>
And I will also rate this film 10 out of 10. This film is very successful at communicating its subject by using the process of tracing the truth. This film starts with the author's surprise about the extreme amount of greenhouse gas caused by animal agriculture, which I think is also to most people's surprise. Then, the film gives us an opportunity for us to follow the author to explore why most big organizations don't mention the problem of animal agriculture. Finally, the author appeals to us to attribute to changing the world.

This documentary really put the scale of the agricultural effects on the climate in perspective for me. I knew our food practices and agriculture had a huge effect on the climate but I didn’t know how far it went and the mass amounts of power the industry holds. Food is such a huge component in climate change and I was most surprised by the environmental organizations denial of its effect. That really took me back that these organizations like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace and such could say they are such proponents for the environment yet refuse to acknowledge the necessity for plant based diets. The meat industry’s reach is so far that it has eliminated anything that could hurt their profits. The political power they have just guarantees their continued profit through subsidies and promotion of meat, enforcing the status quo in the United States. Meat is so deeply ingrained in our culture but it is time to change the culture. The meat industry is exploiting the environment and animals no matter what the cost. We need to change our behavior, it will not come from the government as they back the meat industry so it needs to come from the bottom up. In California at least, plant-based diets are widely popular and many people are going vegetarian and finding substitutes for cow’s milk. I have grown up drinking a lot of milk but this film has made me re-evaluate that. I will be switching to milk substitutes like soy milk and trying different ones. America needs to reconsider its consumption and what we put our money to and what goes into our bodies. The meat industry has too much power in America, it is both immoral and hurting the environment. I am truly going to try to change my behavior after watching this and make better decisions about what I eat and what I waste.

I have been a vegetarian for personal and environmental reasons for over a year now so I found the film “Cowspiracy,” incredibly informative and impactful. The agricultural industry, specifically beef production, is responsible for nearly half of the world's greenhouse emission, mass deforestation and excessive use of resources. We follow the filmmaker as he tries to investigate why the environmental impacts of agriculture are often ignored by environmental organizations and the government. Since the agricultural industry has so much power and capital, those in positions of power and profit are not motivated to make a change to their practices. Individuals too are hesitant to switch or reduce their consumption of unsustainable food sources. I found it incredibly surprising that the number one threat to the the FBI in terms of domestic terroroism is environmental and animal activist groups due to the fact that they threaten potential capital for the agricultural industry.

:I was shocked by a study that showed that  one pound of beef uses 2,500 gallons of water. It also causes deforestation for land raising livestock, drought, extinction of species. It’s sad how organizations are scared to address the main environmental practice: consumption of meat and dairy, because they don’t want to drive their supporters away. Cow’s waste pollutes the ocean’s water. What I found most interesting is that grass fed isn’t as sustainable as it seems. Even though the livestocks have a better life, it takes much more land, more water,and  up to 3.1 billion acres if the agriculture industry were to switch into 100% grass fed beef. What we should do is transition to plant based diet to help our planet.

I too was shocked by the facts presented by the Cowspiracy film. I remember having watched only 10 minutes of the film in a high school health class, but since I never finished it, I didn’t have much to take away from the film. However, now that I have finally watched it, I understand why so many people change their lifestyle choices because of this film. In addition, to respond to your comment on the grass fed portion of the film, I was honestly not aware of just how detrimental grass fed beef could be. I feel extremely torn about this because on one hand, the animals are receiving better treatment—but the earth is getting destroyed on the other. I’m most definitely going to be spreading my newly learned knowledge to my peers. In addition, I appreciate how this film is able to make individuals rethink their lifestyle choices and how/what they consume.

I felt that the Cowspiracy was very alarmist. Don’t get me wrong, I felt that a lot of the information present was very important, especially the stats produced were crazy. When thinking about the consequences of our large animal based agriculture, I did not realize how much resources like water, grain and land we use on animals. The fact that if one of us was to stop eating meat or meat products, we would save 30 square feet of land, 1100 gallons of water, 45lbs of gain and 10lbs of CO2 along with animals life is absolutely astounding. That is only if one person was vegan for a day, so there is no doubt in my mind if we as a society decided to go to a vegan based diet, that our climate crisis would be severely minimized compared to how it is looking currently. It is also crazy to me how many issues are tied with animal agriculture and how far it reaches. I had no clue how bad fish have it right now. The fact that 3 of 4 fisheries worldwide exploit fish and are making it so that there will be no fish by the year 2048. It brings me back to my childhood watching nemo getting scooped up in the giant fishing net and how many fish were also caught and screaming and how there was such a variety that the fisherman could not have even wanted.

   <br><br>

The one thing that genuinely made me very angry about this documentary was after Ken said the fact was not right that 55% of emissions come from animal agriculture. This one fact was very scary. Not saying animal agriculture being 15% of our emissions is not scary, but there is a big difference. I believe this ruins some of the credibility of the documentary for me. Since such a big statistic was overlooked, it is hard for me to imagine that something else was not overlooked. I am not saying I am debunking every claim in the documentary now, in fact most of the points made in Cowspiracy made me rethink how I live my life. I am just saying it is trying to serve the purpose of making more people become vegan or do something to stop or lessen animal agriculture, so as a viewer in general, it may be hard to discern is the narrator trying to help his point vs what is factual.

I agree completely with you, to me it also felt very alarmist. The information was very important and interesting. The amount of water used for animal agriculture was so bizarre to me. I was also surprised about how much land and water is used in the meat industry and how they affect amazons. Watching the politicians and organizations try to avoid the meat mention was also interesting and sort of funny. They literally looked dumb talking about saving water and how fossil fuel is the only leading cause, but when they were asked about the meat they went silent or refused to answer. They were literally clueless yet they are the ones who are informing people, so they should know. The part about how many activists were killed by the meat industry was also so baffling. The meat industry is literally that crazy, like honestly mental, how can they kill these activists for disagreeing and trying to inform people of the real truth. Money really has become more important than anything else.
   <br><br>
I agree too, when the percentage was clarified by Ken, it did sort of discredit what I watched a bit. I noticed that a lot of people didn’t believe much of what Kip Anderson stated in his documentary. This was a repeated percentage so for it to be overlooked does make me question as well what else could have been overlooked. Most of the documentary was convincing though, it really makes you think and shows you how these organizations that claim to be about climate change, don’t talk about the most important which is the meat industry. However also makes you see how the meat industry pretty much rules and will continue to because of the fact that they threaten anybody who shows the true impacts they create in the environment.

In my personal opinion, the film does not communicate the subject that the animal agriculture is the primary source of environmental destruction. The film provides some invalid information about animal agriculture, like the total greenhouse gas emission. Audience also cannot determine whether the the information and data are true, because the film does not provide authoritative source. In addition, most of the scientists showed in the film does not familiar with these numbers. So they cannot give viewers certain answers about how animal agriculture effect the environment.
   <br><br>
The film tries to convince causal viewers who have not pay attention to the problem about animal agriculture. Because the film cited different numbers about the side effects of animal agriculture. These comparison between numbers, like raising cattle emits more green house than transportation emits, will attract viewers to see the problems with animal agriculture.
   <br><br>
The film is very impressive for me. I never think about that the animal agriculture will be one of the most influential part of global warming. my response is emotional, because I am very shocked. In the film, it reminded sister Dorothy Stang who against cattle ranching. She was killed on the road go back home. Also there are more than 1100 scientists were killed in Brazil, because they against he cattle ranching. That is the reason why so may scientists do not want to talk about the side effects of animal agriculture. Lots of authoritative website also do not have these information about animal agriculture.

<p>
Before watching the film Cowspiracy, I used to believe that global warming was largely due to human use of fossil fuels. However, this film reminded me of the enormous effect of raising cows. I think the director describes the story in an interesting way. He shoots the film from a special perspective. He leads us audience to experience what he experiences. The governments refuse to cooperate, people kill millions of animals every year, and environmental activists are repressed because of their standpoint. I am astonished when I see animals was killed by people. We just simply enjoy the food without imaging what the animals look like before they are killed. We don't kill them, but we are the indirect murderers. The film gives me new clues about global warming and its connection with human behaviors. So I begin wondering about the future of humans. Like the film says, if we all switch to “a plant-based diet”, would the situation be better?

I definitely agree with you. I think the first thing that people thought of before they eat meat would be how delicious it is, and I am willing to bet if that first thought was instead of how an animal was slaughtered for it, a lot of people would be vegan. We as humans have longed been living in bliss and thus forget about how meat is made. It is not from Burger King or McDonald's, but from an animal that had a mother and a father, and maybe it even had children of its own that it cared for. Nah, but it bet it will be yummy. Not only livestock are very inefficient energy converters, but they also produce a staggering amount of greenhouse gases that exceed the transportation sector. Why drive a Tesla or bike if a burger will make you just as guilty. I think if we all switch to a plant-based diet obviously we will all be fine, if not even better. With diabetes as one of the leading causes of death in America, wouldn't you think a little green would help? There are many substitutes for animal products, and I think people make excuses for not trying them not because they are scared of lack of nutrients, but because of the alteration in taste. Don't you think it is kind of immoral that animals have to die to satisfy your palates?

The film conveys the idea that we can and we must change the world which can start right away by stopping to eat meat. The main idea is successfully conveyed by the voice-overs and interviews which together show audience a logical reasoning of the how massive the negative impact of animal agriculture is on our planet. I think the audience is the casual viewers for there is seldom professional phrases but all understandable descriptions for people outside the environmental studies areas. 
   <br><br>

I feel really shocked after watching the film for i always thought burning fossil fuels is the major cost of the greenhouse gas issue and global warming. I never think about that eating meat could cause this much consumption of water and grains. Also i have never thought about the fact that some environmental organizations are highly possible hiding the truth from us. I think for me it might be hard to stop eating meat or dairy completely right now, but I will start to eat less meat progressively  every day and convey this shocking message to people around me. In all, I feel pessimistic after viewing the film for this really change the way growing up I believed. I will definitely recommend this movie to my friends.

The film Cowspiracy, by Kip Anderson, goes into the real issues and impacts the agricultural industry has on our planet. My initial response to this film straight from the beginning was emotional. Agriculture is destroying our planet in more ways than most people think about and it made me feel like I've been lied to for a while. We are supposed to be able to trust companies like Greenpeace and Oceana to let us know what we are doing wrong but they were shown as very deceiving in this film with telling us to eat fish to save them or no comment at all. The agricultural industry is silencing people with their money and political power and it is unbelievably wrong. I am even more proud to be vegan because of this film. I can't change others but I can contribute myself as much as possible to help save the earth. The film made me pessimistic because of the fact that we can't really trust anyone to tell us the truth. I can do what I can but most people don't want to give up meat for their own selfish reasons and don't care to hear the facts. We would never be able to satisfy the world with meat in any way because of the land and resources it takes to produce. I have already recommended this film to multiple family members because it is a huge game-changer.

I also felt emotional after watching Cowspiracy because I never knew how organizations -- even ones that vow to protect our planet like Oceana and Greenpeace -- refused to address the number one threat to the destruction of rainforests, animal agriculture. It was horrifying to find out that over 1,100 activists like Dorothy Stang were murdered in Brazil over the span of 20 years for taking action against and speaking out against agribusiness. After watching the film, I can say that I respect vegans way more than I ever did before. I had never realized how much of an impact they had in the fight against the climate crisis, and I now plan to start trending toward a plant-based diet myself. However, I felt like it was not the smartest move by Kip Anderson to depict the environmental organizations as antagonists. Sure, they lied to their members, but at the end of the day they are still operating to help the planet even if in a manner that is not as impactful. I believe that these organizations should simply tell the truth that they can't address animal agriculture because of higher political authorities, instead of trying to lie about what the main cause of rainforest destruction is.

It confused me as to why we were asked to watch an entire documentary that wasn’t based on real facts and made me not believe anything else that he mentioned. However, I then noticed that sometimes in order to make a small change you have to use a larger problem. It is true that the meat industry has huge environmental impacts and that we do need to switch to a plant-based diet in order for this issue to be resolved. Within the documentary he mentioned facts such as: livestock property makes up 98% of the biomass while the rest of the 2% are wild, free living animals; 116,000 lbs of farm animal excrement is produced every second in the U.S. alone; between 40 and 50 million sharks are killed each year; etc. Now that I know that the main fact wasn’t true its hard to believe that all of the other facts were true; however, after watching the documentary I made the decision to switch to a plant-based diet because it truly scared me and influenced me to do so. I believe what his main goal was influential but I’m just not sure if others would have the same opinion. It made me really worried to watch the people that are supposed to be the experts on helping the environment weren’t able to right away have true facts to back up why they did not include the livestock’s negative impact portion. I hope that we will be able to switch our culturally formulated diet and wasting management quickly in order to the staggering reduction of 137 gigatons of CO2. 
<br><br>
I was intrigued when I heard the use of the word freegan. My father used to tell us stories of how he and his friends, after a long day at training for college football, waited outside of Mcdonalds to grab the bag of all of the wasted/uneaten hamburgers. During these stories I wouldn’t think about the environment but this idea is a real idea. The amount of food that we Americans waste is outrageous and needs to end. I believe if we not only switch to a largely plant-based diet but also eat smaller portions of food, we can make that difference that the environment is in need of.

I was a bit disappointed learning that the director of the movie presented some false information. As Ken mentioned, only 15% of animal production accounts for greenhouse emissions, not 50% as stated in the film. Nonetheless, the truth is undeniable: animal production is one of the most influential factors on the impact of climate change. It was very interesting, and even slightly terrifying, watching the interviewees dodge the questions regarding animal production and the toll raising farm animals, especially cows, has on the environment. It’s very concerning watching people representing huge organizations portrayed as “the good guys” essentially try to sweep this information under the rug because this is something their supporters are passionate about and they fear they might upset them. The fact that organizations that many people trust and fund are not presenting all the data that many people are not even aware of is worrisome.

After watching the movie, it is disappointing to hear that a director of such a film was using false information in claiming that 50% of greenhouse emissions are caused by animal products rather than the true 15%, but it still makes the point that the raising and production of meat products are one of the most important factors if we are to focus on limiting the effects of climate change. I also agree that it's disturbing to watch the people being interviewed that represent huge corporations dodge questions and try to manipulate the conversation to where they can be the "good guys" of the situation by covering up the facts. I think this is kinda disgusting because those who know better than to believe their arguments because they're based upon faulty reasoning and biased science, however those that don't know much about the climate crisis and whats going on wouldn't be able to see through it and could align themselves with the representatives of such, and I feel that can be very concerning and dangerous.


<br><hr>
Providing false facts acts as a dangerous game as many on the conservative side will do anything to fight your credibility and make you look bad or like you're trying to hurt the American public. But like you had said animal agriculture is still an issue, not only by harming the environment but the lives of those animals as they suffer terrible conditions and deal with poor care. Those conversations need to be had as people will look at a dog being abused and say how terrible that is, but won't look at a cow in the same light because dogs are more humanized or other reasons as well. Lots of things are hidden and kept quiet because many people can be bought or contracts that will cause legal action if broken that will inevitably destroy a person. So honestly with corporations having so much money gives them so much power to do what they please, but at the end of the day, that money won't buy not one of them true happiness.

It is funny to me how many organizations claim to champion for the environment but will not address the negative effects of animal agriculture. It is obvious that livestock production is an environmental issue as the film states: “methane gas from livestock is 86 times more destructive than carbon dioxide from vehicles.” Why won’t these organizations that are supposed to be helping the environment offer solutions to, or even acknowledge the biggest cause of the climate crisis? Money and reputation. These organizations would rather keep their followers content with minimal lifestyle changes, than ask them to do something that would actually make a significant difference. They do this because they are afraid they will lose money and support. It is the same reason oil companies send out propaganda stating climate change is fake. Even if these companies claim to be environmental supporters, at the end of the day they have a different goal.

It is just so odd to me that the older generation seems to believe that meat is SO essential to our intake. Yes, we need protein and this and that but why should meat be the only way that we can get these nutrients. Meat has only been widely available in the western world for a couple hundred years, how do people think that we got by before meat? The logic behind "meat being integral to our diet" is just ridiculous and is upsetting on all fronts. I don't want to be apart making something like that acceptable but obviously like anyone else i am not an exception from the blame. We all have a part to play whether we like it or not. We all have have room to improve and we all need to be looking at what WE can do rather than what OTHERS can do, because in the end all we can do is make an individual impact.

I completely agree. In talking with my grandparents and other relatives they describe the amount of meat they ate per day as much smaller than what we think of us “normal”. We now eat meat for every meal: sausage for breakfast, turkey sandwich for lunch, hamburger for dinner. However a hundred years ago (or less) meat was eaten something like once a day, or in MUCH smaller portions. In my highschool AP environmental science class we discussed the biological evidence between humans not evolving to be mainstream carnivores. For example our teeth and jaws resemble those of herbivores rather than carnivores, and the way our stomachs work support that concluscion as well. This is not to say we haven’t evolved to eat meat, only that we original either did not or ate it very little. Additionally even those who like to eat meat and believe we should be eating it can not honestly think the dairy or meat industries are humane. Not to get preachy but carbon footprints aside, cowspiracy once again highlights the terrible conditions of the livestock animals we rasise  to eat. I honestly have no problem eating eggs from my chicken coop at home but watching footage from the inside of mass produced egg farms make me feel sick. As Sean mentions above, we can’t do anything more than hold ourselves responsible to living by our own morals.

I will be honest, the idea of not eating meat anymore has always been a big problem for me. I never understood why people simply stopped eating meat not due to a health problem. I didn't understand what the big problem with eating meant was. I always believed that cows and other animals like that were intended upon being eaten. Little did I understand the large scale corporations and problems that are related to agricultural and livestock. Many people are unwilling to learn more about the effects of the meat and agricultural industries. I have always had the idea that it would be too hard to cut met out of my diet and how would I keep up the health intake that meant provides. Now that I am in college, I thought it would be especially hard to not eat meat with the dining halls. I couldn't imagine myself only eating a salad three times a day. Again I was not very well informed. I have now started however, to slowly lessen my meat intake and start to repeal it from my diet. It isn't as hard as I or many other believe it to be. There are so many different options for people who don't eat meat. Also there are plenty of alternative ways to get the required nutrients and healthy intake other than meant. This film really motivated me to actually make the change in my own diet and life. I have had friends who have told me to start but I never really cared enough to do anything about it.

I knew that livestock contributed to the climate crisis but I had not even the slightest idea of how much it truly is impacting the Earth. I was also extremely surprised at the fact that the number one reason for deforestation is to make space for livestock to graze, and that it takes 600 gallons of water for a pound of beef. Those numbers are way too high to sustain that way of living. It makes me think of how many people are blind to these facts and those who know the facts but how many know they have to make lifestyle changes yet refuse to do so.

After watching Cowspiracy, I am really dumbfounded. This movie put together a mass of data to support an argument that industrial food production leading contributor to global warming. I think the movie was deficient in one regard, a regard which most movies about global warming fail in that they do not address the fact that we, the consumers of gas & oil and of beef, eggs & dairy products, are not willing to change our ways. On the other hand, If you really want to save the planet and focus on what's important this is a great head starter to your research, it focuses on a main issue and not just usual turn off your faucets well and take short showers to save planet earth. The most compelling portions of the film are the interviews conducted with 'environmentally aware' organizations and its exposure of their ignorance or intentional avoidance of the most severe environmental issues of our day. It's a huge eye opener and i'm glad i had the opportunity to watch it. This is the movie everyone needs to see! This planet and all life on it is suffering badly and the reason is us. We have to change our lifestyle and consumption. For a better world and the generations to come!

In the US, 40% of the food that is produced is wasted, which is absolutely insane. But, the movie “Wasted: The Story of Food Waste” provides many inspirational and interesting methods on how people/societies around the world are trying to curb their food waste. (For example, Chef Dan Barber believes that limited options of nourishment causes you to be more creative with what food you make and he tries to make the most delicious food out of whatever he grows on the farm). I really liked the fact that Hambleton Ales is making beer out of what would be wasted bread (from all of the sliced bread that is not considered “good enough” to be packaged). But, although this seems to be working for sliced bread, what about all of the other wasted foods? This is a step in the right direction, but it has too small of an effect to truly turn around all of the years of food waste made by humans.
<br><br>

I think that the factory that is saving $2.4 million per year due to their use of anaerobic digestion in their production process is very inspirational. This is a process that actually would make a lot of sense for other factories to implement- they save a lot of money and are also reducing their waste at the same time. It’s a win-win situation for climate change activists and the people/companies who own the factories.
<br><br>

Also, the fact that Korea has eliminated almost all of their food waste from entering landfills is amazing. Why can’t America look into methods such as the use of keycards to open automated bins that are for food waste only? This would absolutely work for almost every family home and it would be fairly easy to implement, especially in cities that are already trying to implement a “greener” mindset within the different communities making up that specific city.

Credibility was a hot theme in Cowspiracy. I am not happy that the filmmaker reported false data, even with the best intentions. It might have been a script error but it can also get a lot of push back and prove a lot of people right. But I wanted to talk a little about the credibility of the companies discussed in the film. A lot of these companies that sounded as if they cared for the environment, were actually the complete opposite. It was misleading to me how companies named “Greenpeace” or “Animal Agriculture Alliance” sounded whole-some and environmentally empowered but were not willing to speak on certain issues. It says a lot. The interview with Howard Lyman struck me. Although I browsed through Greenpeace’s website, I still don’t know if they just didn’t believe in Cowspiracy’s goals or if they were being silenced by the law. I was confused about the actual relevance of cancelled interviews, companies and nonprofits' unwillingness to be interviewed, and the dropped funding of this film until Lyman. It made sense that maybe these companies did not want to be interviewed because they did not believe in the film’s goals but it made even more sense when I realized that it may be illegal for them to discuss anything. I truly think this is mind-boggling because we have all this talk about free speech and “for the people, by the people” but the government prohibits any information that may be upsetting or limit corporations’ profits (which I highly doubt is for the well-being of the people). Although I knew this before, this was prime evidence of corporate controlling the government instead of the other way around. Knowing that environmental and animal rights activists are on the radar of the FBI is frightening and it’s absolutely stupid that trying to protect people and where they live is considered a crime. It’s more like “for the corporate, by the profit.”

I definitely agree with you. If Kip Anderson had simply reported correct statistics, his point about the severity of the agriculture industry’s impact on the environment would have still been communicated. He didn’t have to exaggerate the numbers for people to believe him. The lack of honesty was disappointing, especially considering the importance of his message. The companies that were mentioned in the film were also a let down. You would think that organizations claiming to support the environment would at least include agribusiness as a factor, but unfortunately they are nowhere on their websites. It’s difficult to know who to trust about these facts. 
<br><br>


Regarding the corporate controlling the government, it’s sometimes worrying to think about the fact that our democratic system is flawed and that the people in power are the ones making decisions (as opposed to for the people and by the people). I can feel helpless, especially as a soon-to-be first-time voter. However, I appreciate taking this class because it’s giving me more information about the climate crisis and its impact on policies, as well as policies’ impact on the environment. While we can personally combat the changing climate by eating less meat and boycotting unsustainable farming methods, it’s important to know that we also have a say in our governmental process through voting.

<br><br>

While this film was frustrating, ultimately I think it provided a way for people to understand a factor in the climate crisis that isn’t often touched on. Cowspiracy acted as exposé on the agriculture industry and shed light on details that organizations could be hiding from the people. Although it wasn’t my favorite film of this quarter, I thought it was beneficial that Anderson brought this to public attention but unfortunate that he was not completely transparent.

I did not enjoy the film; this is coming from a vegetarian who is generally against the consumption of meat. As I was watching the film, I noticed much of the information was incorrect or altered in a way to exacerbate the animal agriculture situation. The narrator's was a terrible actor and the plot was slightly corny. 
<br><br>

I learned nothing new from this film. As a vegetarian, I’ve done my fair share of research on how animal agriculture has affected the climate crisis. In fact, this is how I was able to tell some of the information in this video was incorrect. I feel slightly optimistic about this particular topic. More and more people have been going meatless, and the increased vegan demand shows. More restaurants have expanded their meatless menu and vegan alternatives have become more common. 
<br><br>

Its lighting to see that business are adhering to the consumer's demands of healthier, more sustainable food. However, I hope that they stay true to this, and aren't just "greenwashing" their food.  
<br><br>

I would not recommend this movie to a friend. Some of the information in the film is incorrect. I believe it plays into the negative vegan stereotype. If I had a friend who is interested in going meatless I’d just talk to them about my experience myself.

This is not my first time watching Cowspiracy, in fact this movie was what made decide to go vegan. I think the scene that strikes me every time I watch this movie is how shaken Kipp is after the duck is slaughtered in front of him. I think that his reaction demonstrates the disconnect the developed world has from our food. To people living in developing regions, killing your own animal is a part of the food system and you learn to respect and honor the life you take by eating meat. 

<br><br>

I think if the global north understood how resource intensive and cruel the process to make our food was, our consumption would change. We would not be eating meat, would not be eating grain that has been genetically modified and grown in a monoculture which puts small farmers out of business and allows companies like Monsanto to monopolize food. We would buy fair trade and local products and ensure that the works were paid fairly. Honestly this should be taught to children in school but agribusiness has too strong of a hold on the US government for education standards to be changed.

In response to you, I would like to applaud you for committing to veganism. I know how hard that is to maintain and it is inspiring to hear that it is manageable. In addition, I would like to say that the duck scene was miserable to watch. Kipp’s response was triggering and daunting. I understand how that urged you to make that decision. Thank you for doing your part in helping the planet- surely that is something I could not. 
 <br><br>

While I watched the slaughtering of the duck, I knew that veganism/ vegetarianism was something I could not commit to. I know this a stretch but I think the reason I don’t feel bad about eating animals is because I have never had a pet before. I know that has no effect but for me I think it represents how I really have no relationship with animals so I don’t feel bad if they are getting killed. I know reasons for vegetarianism vary but I think the driving force for many is because of the cruelty for animals. If I were going to stop eating meat, it would definitely just be for the animals. 
<br><br>

Based on all of my comments, it appears that I would have trouble making any of the decisions they proposed. With that said, I think vegetarianism/ veganism would be the hardest for me. I could give up shopping, driving, regular light bulbs etc. I just don’t see myself being able to sustain on a plant based diet. So what I will do, is eat more fish!


<br><hr>
This was also not my first time watching Cowspiracy but I wanted to watch it again from an environmental lens. The first time I watched it was many years ago and I only watched it because those that knew I was vegan said that it should watch it. I enjoyed the film much more this time around because I have gained more knowledge about global warming through the few weeks in this class. I think looking at this film from an environmental perspective makes it a little bit more interesting because you can really see this disconnect in people trying to support sustainable approaches but as the film makes clear there is no way to make sustainable animal agriculture practices that could feed the world. 
 <br><br>


I agree with you that one of the most shocking parts of the film is when he is so upset by watching the duck get killed that he doesn’t pursue any more information into home farming practices. I personally think that lots of people would be vegan if it were to be required that we kill our own meat. I think for years this practices has been taken out of our minds because we now rely on others to do it for us. I also think that to change this it would require a huge shift in not just cultural practices but with the government. As it was mentioned in the film as well as in the reading this week the actual price of meat is not represented in what people pay. We need to stop governmental price distorting because this allows people to continue eating meat. 
 
<br><br>

In response to Ken’s claim about the accuracy within this film I personally don’t think it matters that much that he was inaccurate. In comparison to one of the first readings of this class we discussed if being an “alarmist” is hurting or helping the planet. And I think that this is just another example of someone being an alarmist but in regards to the effects of animal agriculture. I don’t think miss representing the facts makes much a difference because it’s all in the effort of showing the problem. If it helps others understand the severity of the situation better then I think so be it. 
 <br><br>

I agree with your last comment that we need to be educating young people about buying local produce and teaching them about the negative affects that animal agriculture has on our planet.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that the scene in “Cowspiracy”, after Kip Anderson watched a man slaughter a duck, was painful to watch, and support her idea that “his reaction demonstrates the disconnect the developed world has from our food”. I applaud Madison, and all other vegans, for being able to eat a strictly plant based diet. Personally, I would not be able to give up eating chicken. I have never eaten beef, or any type of red meat for that matter, in my entire life. I have never even tried it. For me, it is more of a taste aspect, but after watching Cowspiracy, I can see that my not eating beef is greatly helping reduce my personal carbon footprint. If people all over the world decided to make small lifestyle changes, such as not eating meat for one day each week, we could see a small improvement in our climate. Little steps toward bettering our Earth only lead to bigger ones, and eventually, we could all be eating vegetarian or vegan. 
<br><br>

I also enjoyed Madison’s comment about how it is hard to educate young people about the harsh realities of animal agriculture because “agribusiness has too strong of a hold on the US government for education standards to be changed”. Similarly to our focus on climate change deniers, and how they began infiltrating the education systems by sending out free books ‘debunking’ climate change to teachers, the agribusiness will not allow many people to understand how much they are aiding to climate change as a whole. We could be raising children who are ready to fight on climate change, but they are not being given the proper resources and information to do so. 
<br><br>

Finally, I had a thought on Ken’s video lecture where he talked about about “freegans”. This idea seemed like a total fad to me. It seems impossible for anyone to be able to survive only eating store and restaurant scraps. I would never be able to be a freegan, and even if our environment depended on the entire population being freegans, I do not think we could rely on the world to become freegan. Overall, the idea just seems a bit silly to me.

Cowspiracy frustrates me. I think basing his argument on incorrect facts majorly undercuts the credibility of Andersen. Especially because I don't know what other bits of his argument are exaggerated. When seeking out educational material on a topic that's as important to me as this, I'd like it to be one that is both moving and factually accurate. Although his exaggeration can help his argument and help to convince more viewers, the spreading of false information is not a line I consider crossing, even for the sake of a greater good in mind. In today's political atmosphere, the blatant spreading of falsities and stretched truths is very common and has become accepted as an aspect of American media and politics. If activists fighting climate change want the American people to start believing in science again, then the spread of false information is completely counterintuitive to that goal. I was also frustrated because Andersen uses this film to paint major environmental organizations as antagonists in the fight against climate change. I find that doing this can alienate people from the organizations that are at the front lines of this crisis and attempting to make a bigger impact. Climate change requires a united front to fight it, so making the people that are on your side look like villains doesn’t help.

This documentary shocks me a lot since as for me, I would think that fossil fuels are the major cause of climate crisis and high greenhouse emissions. I would say human contributes to most of the situation we see nowadays. However, it is a human-caused issue, but it is indirectly resulted by human beings rather directly lead to. We consume meat for food, and cattle or other farmed animals consume our resources, like water, land, agriculture, and even labor force. Then they will produce a huge amount of greenhouse gases, like methane, which is 86 times more destructive than CO2. And the release of CO2 by livestock is even bigger than it by the transportation sector. This is totally unbelievable. This even changes my mind and beliefs toward climate change. we should reconsider the issue and find out the true cause and culprit of the climate crisis. In this way, we can better change or control the condition. Moreover, it is quite ironic that when the man asks about the effects of livestock and cattle brought to forests and climate, governments and relative climate workers are silent and refuse to answer. I think that might because they do not consider this as a major cause of emissions of climate change, or they just do not want to say, in other words, they might want to hide something. I feel really sad about this as if we can’t trust governments and organizations that are “protecting” our planet, but cannot face the potential cause directly, how can individuals do and know the truth of it? Hence, how should we make a change?

I do agree with you about how these organizations almost seem to “beat around the bush” when it comes to discussing how agriculture affects the environment or to not even acknowledge it. But I disagree with what you said about how these climate organizations are hiding information or do not think it has a big impact on the planet. I believe that these organizations may not want to talk about these issues because they are afraid to. A good example is the reaction Leila Salazar Lopez, the program director of Amazon Watch, had when she was kind of pushed to answer about it. Her demeanor changed to almost a fearful tone but she did admit that cattle especially is a leading cause of deforestation in the Amazon. She did also mention however, that other people were more openly talking about these issues and they were murdered for their ideals, people such as Sister Dorothy Stang. While I believe that these issues should be discussed openly and more publicly I do not know if I can encourage people to do so. If people are being killed for just speaking out against different ideals, then maybe there is a better solution to speaking out against it.


<br><Hr>
I totally agree with you in that the silence of the major corporations when being asked to interview is horrible. I truly. believe that the heads of the major businesses will not start to care about the environment until they are directly affected by it. Most likely, this will not happen anytime soon because they have the money to avoid the environmental consequences caused by global warming. That said, it is up to the majority to vote and protest for the greater good of the population and for the health of our planet. What also needs to happen is a transition from a fossil fuel economy to a clean fuel source economy in the United States as well as worldwide. This,  on top of the food waste, and large scale animal farming is what is detrimental to our planet. Although there were times in the film where they had lost my attention, I think that the overall message in this film was portrayed effectively. I have talked to many friends after they had watched the film and they told me they no longer wanted to eat meat... it disgusted them. This is obviously a good thing, and if we can get more people to view the documentary we could expect similar results.

Making the incorrect facts definitely will reduce the credibility of this film. Some people might think this film is exaggerating the effects of animal agriculture, so they choose not to believe that animal agriculture will have a negative effect on the earth.
<br><br>
From my perspective, this film is pretty effective. It shows how animal agriculture brings negative effects to the earth’s environment by showing diagrams, statistics, and empirical studies. Before I watched this documentary, I had never thought eating meat would kill the earth. This documentary brings me a new version of protecting the environment.
<br><br>
The audience of this film might be the normal audience who knows a little about this topic. Because for most people, they would not think that eating beef will cause a bad effect on the environment. So the audience might be those who do not know this topic much, and this film is going to tell them and appeal to them to protect the earth from not eating beef.
<br><br>
When I watch this documentary, my response is intellectual. Although I feel sad and bad when I see how animal agriculture causes damage to the earth, I know it is impossible for everyone to be vegetarian. Being vegetarian is the best solution to this issue, but it is impossible. Everyone has the right to decide what they want to eat, so there can not be a law to inhibit from eating meat, which is a sad fact. So when I watch this film, I feel sad and want to save the earth, but at the same time, I feel hopeless about the solutions.
<br><br>
I learnt not only will burning fossil fuels and wastes cause damage to the earth, but also human’s diet is destroying the earth too. This film changed my attitude to eating beef. Maybe in the future, I will reduce my beef consumption. I feel pessimistic about this issue, because to solve this issue, it is too hard and almost impossible for everyone not to consume beef. 
<br><br>
I would recommend this film to my friends, because we never thought that our diet will cause damage to the earth. I hope them after watching this film will notice and pay attention to the diet so that we do our parts to protect the earth.

The film introduced the issue of animal agriculture to the audience. In the film, it used a lot of professional and trustworthy statistics to offer people a direct understanding of the way animal agriculture influences the environment in a negative way. And it shows that a lot of organizations which are supposed to advocate for environmental justice and educate people about the reasons that cause all those environmental issues are actually ignoring the issue of animal agriculture. This helps to let people reflect on their own behaviors and whether they are really doing the right things to help the planet. People who are already concerned with the issue can learn more information about the severeness of the situation. Because by using the powerful statistics, the film successfully supports the main idea that animal agriculture is causing a lot of environmental problems and wasting a huge amount of natural resources. It challenges many beliefs of the casual viewers about environmental issues, such as building water efficient homes and taking shorter showers may not save more water for future use, because the fundamental problem is caused by animal agriculture. The statistics provided in the film surprised me that I did not realize that the animal agriculture is using so much water and land. It causes me to reflect on my eating habits. I started to notice that I ate a lot of meat, dairy and eggs rather than vegetables and fruits. Even though it is not very possible for me to become a vegan, I would like to consume less products related to animal agriculture to help improve the issue.

The film described the negative impact of animal agriculture on global deforestation and condemn the incorrect action taken by the world’s leading environmental organization towards the issue. I think the film effectively communicates its subject to the audience. At the beginning of the film, the director shows his everyday efforts towards environmental protection, trying to use tiny actions to save nature. Then he shows surprising facts of the huge consumption of animal agriculture. Especially the water cost, “ raising livestock just in the U.S. consume 34 trillion gallons of water.” After showing these astonishing statistics, he also stated that many people try hard to against the overdevelopment of animal agriculture. However, most of them failed and even devote their lives. Thus, the director wonders the attitudes of the worlds’ leading environmental organizations towards animal agriculture. Surprisingly, all the organizations acknowledge that raising livestock hurts the environment a lot but the loss is necessary and beneficial for most big companies. Some of them usually refuse to answer because of afraid and others just state the huge profits minimize the negative effects on nature. These facts are the reality and the director wanted to display them to warn the world. As a result, while people watching the film, they are able to concern with current animal agriculture instead of tricking by environmental organizations that hide truths from folks.

I think the audience of the film should everyone around the world since protecting resources and living places is everyone's duty on the earth. The film is able to let people besides the environmental organizations to know to truths behind. For those people working for environmental organizations, they are required to reflect their improper attitudes and ideas towards animal agriculture. After watching the film, I think everyone may concern about the current situation and take action right away. In my aspect, the film is truly astonishing to me since I never think about the negative impact of animal agriculture. Before I just saw animal agriculture as necessary instead of harming nature. The film put me into deep concern and gave me a different aspect to view environmental protection. I think the film may give me a brand new inspiration to be a vegetarian since reducing animal environmental to save the world seems more persuasive than protecting animals. After watching the film, I felt optimistic since the film itself offered several ways to reduce the harm of animal agriculture. I feel that I am able to do something to make a difference. Just as the film said in the end, “ life today is not about sustainability, it’s about ‘ thrive-ability’.

Cowspiracy is a very good film whose primary objective was to communicate to the general public not only about  the dubious industry and major corporations behind the world population's meat, dairy, eggs, and so on, but educate us about the different type of diets and their good behind them. This documentary brings to light the discussion that every major entitled "protector of land" avoids due to their fear of being prosecuted or taken out. These major meat corporations instill fear into their adversaries; with the profound scene of them digging deep into their death threats and executions of reporters and analysts (by corporations) just to prevent them from bringing out the truth in their mortifying schemes. But overall, the film was effective in communicating the subject and pinpointing the corporations' malice and corruption not only from deep within the headquarters but within the government as well. Throughout the documentary, it intellectually spoke to me. I followed along and was intrigued by the mind-boggling numbers and data that they had recollected. It made me think of how these corporations only blame the general public's consumption, yet they're the ones who are intermittently destroying the environment through their over-production of food and careless ways of manufacturing, and attempt to dust off the blame from their shoulders. 
<br><br>
Many things from this documentary have overturned some of my prior notions about the different nutritional values and sustainability between a vegan and classic animal-protein diet, and the truth behind it with reclaimed inquiries from doctors and physicians. It also showed me the true work and consumption of raising cattle and its eradication of earth and its resources. But mostly, the culture and beneficial aspects in vegan and vegetarian diets, really outweighed everything else, and it intrigued me how it would take almost 1/18 of the amount of an animal protein diet to feed the same amount of people; not only would it take less space and be more environmentally efficient, but way more beneficial and enriching. I felt a little pessimistic considering my high consumption of meat and how I am part of the problem, but how I could change my diet for not only the betterment of Earth but my health as well.
<br><br>
It’s truly mortifying to think that the very corporations that put the food on our plates, from breakfast to dinner, are the leading cause for deforestation, water consumption and pollution, more greenhouse gases production than transportation industry, rainforest and species extinction, habitat loss, top soil erosion, and much much more that fucks up this planet. Yet here we are, still giving in to these major corps, not only just continuing our destructive ways, but helping these vil corporations profit out of our blatant ignorance. We need to change our lifestyles through our diets. Our future lies within our appetites.

Wasted
<br><br>
Consumers could see how terrifying the food wasted everyday in America, almost 1.3 billion tons of food is thrown away and the documentary will let consumers to reconsider the relationship with food and the consequences after throwing it away. Foods with short shelf lives get wasted easily before few months of its expiration date because companies would not want the responsibility of food security. But those items are still editable and good to consume. People will pack their leftover in the restaurants to bring it home to act less wasteful but forget it in the fridge for days. But they still feel like they are wasting food since they “planned” to consume it. The film inspires me a lot and change my points of view about food relationship with my daily life, I feel I need to pay more attention about my food consumption to avoid too much waste.

Cowspiracy is the reason that no longer eat meat like the average american. I came across this film as a freshman in high school. To say the least I was absolutely appalled by what I had seen and learned - it is the reason why I have sustained from eating meat and influenced others to do the same. Not only is Kip Anderson brave to make such a radical film against the meat industry, but he is inspirational. I was inspired to completely reevaluate my diet. I must admit that until that point, I was an avid meat eater. Anything from your regular cattle meat to pork or lamb. I used to love lamb. But my affliction for red meat stood no chance against my morality. After watching this film I was completely inspired to learn more about the environment and just how everything we do impacts the world around us. When I first started this journey, it was incredibly hard to avoid meat - this animal protein had become a staple at our dining table. My consistency would falter here and there, and I would get incredibly frustrated with myself. As time went by, I made it a habit to seek out alternative foods and sources of protein. It has been about four years since I made the decision to remove meat and dairy from my diet, and I have stopped craving it completely. In addition to removing these unsustainable sources of protein from my diet, I too have influenced my family to some extent, do the same. I mean, my family used to heavily consume red meat, and now my family has reduced their meat intake to once a month or not at all for extended periods of time. They haven't completely removed it from their diet, but they’ve come a long way. And have still some way to go. But the point is, that we all can do this. We don’t have to eat meat everyday like some savage carnivores.

To say the sheer amount of methane gas emissions coming from the meat packing industry is an issue would be a gross understatement.  Not only is the practice of the industry itself a an actual shitshow that grossly murders animals for the profit and benefit of humans, but since most of the animals that get killed for meat aren’t fully used for their entirety in the United States, the meat packing produces an enormous amount of waste that awfully effects our environment.  Following my viewing of the documentary, Cowspiracy, I did some of my own research upon the facts and figures of the documentary and saw most of them were exaggerated; most likely for theatrical purposes of the movie and to further convince people of the effects of meat consumption upon climate change.  It was disappointing to see they weren’t transparent in the way they conveyed their message, but I was at least a little relieved to see their exaggerations weren’t ridiculous.

I thought the film was great but it does worry. Ken did point out that the director presented incorrect figures. Obviously, if you believe the scientists and acknowledge that climate change is happening, you might toss that aside. I am worried about the viewers who do not acknoweldge climate change who hear that 50% of carbon emissions belong to animal production. Sometimes it takes one fact to change their stance on an issue.

Kip Anderson's use of incorrect statistics helps him convey the significance of the meat industries contributions, making his argument stronger for those who are not informed on the situation. However, for those who have background knowledge and realize that the figures he quotes are wrong, it reduces his credibility greatly since he should be well informed on the topic given the lengths he has gone to with it. While the film still gives a good look into the reality of the meat industry, it undermines the message when some of the key facts are incorrect. Plant based diets can reduce much of the impact we have today on the environment, since meat production consumes so many resources while creating emissions. I started trying to avoid red meat after hearing how detrimental it is to the environment. I don't feel like I'm missing out on much so hopefully more people will be able to come around and make similar diet changes themselves.

The blatant corruption that is evident among cattle companies and organizations is baffling. The fact that no environmental organizations web page mentions that agrobusiness is the number one contributor of greenhouse gas emissions was extremely surprising. And in his interviews with important people at each organization, they would squirm under the question.  Then when he goes deeper into it, and interviews the woman from the Amazon Watch, she mentions that the cattle and soybean companies, in the past, have shot and killed people who spoke out against the farming business. Also the fact that it is likely that many of these organizations get donations from the cattle industry to keep them quite questions the whole point of these organizations. If they are leaving out the number one polluter, they are not doing what they are fundamentally supposed to do.

I think this documentary is very important, because it makes it very clear and evident that cows are extremely unsustainable. I used to eat local grass fed beef, however COwspiricy explained that if all the beef produced was grassfed, we would have to wipe the planet clean of all cities in order to fit pastures for all of the beef. So that is definitely not sustainable. An intense wake up call.

Who would have thought that livestock produces more greenhouse gases than the emission of cars, buses and all the transportation systems ? that’s what I thought, but after watching Kens video it’s upsetting to learn that they based their arguments on wrong percentages, which I think harms the producer’s credibility. However, as we have learned, we know that methane gas is more dangerous thanCO2Thus cows only produce methane gas from their digestive process, which is 86 times more destructive than the CO2from cars. Livestock are a huge part of the climate crisis, yet we do not know about it. It’s shocking that fracking uses 100 billion gallons of water, while animal agriculture uses about 34 TRILLION GALLONS! And their greenhouse emissions are about the same, but have in mind that fracking is the #1 polluting industry. Overall, “the leading cause of environmental destruction is animal agriculture” , yet no one's doing anything about it. It is ironic that the directors and executives from big corporations “designed” to contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle and contribute to the wellbeing of all species and any type of life on this planet, are not doing what they are supposed to.
<br><br>
For instance, Ocenia, being the largest ocean conservation group, recommends eating fish while experts suggest banning fishing. While watching this documentary I found myself confused and mad. I do not get how are the only corporations that we have and thought we could rely on, not taking care and educating us, rather hiding and rejecting the truth.  This system is so corrupt and they seem to not be ashamed of it, watching those people laughing made me so mad because they are the ones with the money and power to do so much .This just reinforces the idea that we must use our power to vote for legislators that support solutions for the climate crisis. There is no such thing as sustainable fishing. We need to stop, there is nothing good about destroying habits. Similarly , the leading cause of rainforest destruction is agriculture. Animal agriculture has a huge impact, and it’s scary that over 11000 activists have been killed in the last 20 years in Brazil that were rotestings against these activities. Environmental organizations are refusing to act against animal agriculture, “they are failing us”, but why ? There is just no way to sustainability raise livestock, thus we have to be mindful of the aliments we eat and where they come from, as well as encourage others to switch to a plant based diet. We have to be mindful of how much water we are using. We cannot trust this “environmental” agencies anymore, even the government— Animal rights and environmental activists are the number one domestic terrorism threat according to FBI. 
<br><br>
Since the main environmental organizations are not doing their job well and are not addressing these issues, we must act now. It’s a necessity, acting on what we know, we can do it but once again it's our personal decision that involves a cultural change, and we can start by choosing what we eat. “We must change the world” and a plant-based diet is the best sustainable diet, while also reducing our food waste.

<p>
Some notable points from Cowspiracy are that 
<br><br>
13% of emissions come from transportation while 18% comes from cattle raising. 100 billion gallons of water are used for fracking and the methane emissions are equal for that and cattle farming. Animals use water intensive grains. 1/4lb burger used 660 gallons of water. 2500gallons of water are used for 1 lb of beef. 51% of all greenhouse gases are due to animal agriculture and it is the #1 anthropogenic polluter. 1/3 of our planets fresh water and 45% of earths land is used on agriculture. Grass fed beef is more unsustainable than factory farming. 1000 gallons of water are used for 1 gallon of milk.      All of these “facts” caught my attention but then I heard that many facts in this film were actually not true. I feel like using hyperbolic statistics was a tactic for alarming people and scaring them into eating a plant based died. However I feel like this has an opposite effect because people will discredit the film for false information and the use of propaganda. In fact, I watched this film with two friend who are not in the climate class with Ken and they were immediately skeptical about the film. I side with Ken when he states that reducing our waste of food is the best solution. I feel like we don’t know enough about the impacts of the cattle raising industry but we do know that being wasteful can be avoided.

I think this film is quite an effective work. 
<br><br>
While I had previously felt pretty good about my lifestyle choices eating just fish and eggs, it made me realize that really there is no other way to be completely sustainable than to just cut animal products out completely. While we may be presented with "sustainable" options all the time, the fact of the matter is that animal products are not sustainable. You can distract from the fact with things like grass fed beef and sustainable fish and cage free eggs, but those options are still detrimental to our environment
<br><br>
After reading a lot of comments, it’s crazy to see how many people have already switched to a plant based diet or are thinking about switching to one. However, its lack of solid sources and credibility makes it easy to undermine by animal agriculture propagators, which does the opposite of what it’s trying to accomplish. It’s very successful in its rhetoric, and definitely sparked an emotional response, but had they sticked to the facts it would have still been impactful, and there would be a lot more ethos. In trying to convince a broad audience, credibility is important, and the lack of it really harms the communication of the topic.

I definitely agree that this film is quite convincing. The pathos is very strong, and it does a great way of building up disgust and anger at the meat industry. After watching this documentary, I thought strongly about going on a vegetarian or vegan diet. It was astonishing to realize that eating meat at all was not a sustainable practice if we plan on cutting emissions at all. Any amount of meat products is just not going to work if we want to truly stop hurting our planet.
<br><br>
But, as you said, the ethos is certainly lacking as Anderson didn’t fully tell the absolute truth about all of his statistics. Inflated numbers certainly take away from the credibility of this very well produced documentary, which ends up hurting it in the end. Anderson does a great job of putting together an emotionally tugging and action initiating argument, but he takes away from it by stretching the facts. If I was someone skeptical of the vegan movement, this documentary would be truly moving, but if I discovered that his statistics were a bit exaggerated, I would probably dismiss the film as alarmist. I just wish he had remained true to the facts in order to retain credibility for what is otherwise a great documentary.

Hearing that worldwide agriculture is the second largest emitter of greenhouses gases leaves me in a confused state. I am shocked but how is it that we allow ourselves to contribute so much to agriculture that it ranks so highly. Thinking about 1/2-1/3 of food produced is wasted made me so furious I was red. How do we allow that to happen when so many are not even able to get food in the first place. When I was growing up, my grandma would always eat our scraps left over and made sure to always bring back food home from restaurants even if 99% of the food was gone from the plate. I would always wonder and wondered why my grandma was so persistent in bringing back 1/8 of a burger and 5 french fries and she would just tell me I could eat it later. Of course I was oblivious that in Mexico she would eat from the scraps because she would constantly miss meals. Now that I am older I obviously understand that I was so blind to how much food we waste on a daily basis. I wouldn't eat all of my food sometimes and would get frustrated because we had no more room in the fridge because of all the small pieces of food she would save but hearing that 1/3-1/2 of food is wasted really makes it obvious that in America we are conditioned to think throwing away food doesn't matter. Why should it if we have other food available? 
<br><br>

Switching to a plant based diet helps but wasting food is a whole other monster that we especially need to face. As Americans I feel we could never be Freegans, we are too stuck up to even think about eating food that is considered as waste. I remember Ken talking about how Denmark is thinking about putting the carbon output on the food packaging and I cannot help to think that even if it goes unnoticed to some, to others it would be a life changer. This gives stubborn meat eaters an outlet, to still be more environmentally friendly. I know this film had pure intentions but promoting false data does not make me more willing to follow through but makes me infuriated and makes me question the whole film. Data is not the only thing they could be lying about and that feeling is horrible.

I thought “Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret” and “Wasted! The Story of Food Waste” did excellent jobs of investigating the American government’s sketchy role in averting our attention from the agriculture industry, as well as outlining the actions that many nations around the world are taking towards preventing the 90% of food waste that ends up decomposing and producing methane gases in landfills. Food waste is unquestionably a pressing issue that we must address as soon as possible in order to prevent further harm to our ecosystem. These films left me feeling angry and frustrated with the American government. If these nations can afford (“afford,” in reference to wealth and society) to implement these measures, why can’t America, one of the richest nations in the world, do so as well?

I think that the first bit of dialogue with the deputy executive of the Sierra Club in Cowspiracy is a perfect parallel to what's going on on a larger scale: Kip tries to connect with countless climate activist groups and authors only for many of them to basically stare at him and pretend that livestock is not the monstrous problem that it has become. It's concerning to see that the very people that are supposedly aiming to save the planet are businesses in the end and purposefully avoid the topic of animal agriculture to save both face and money. In the documentary, Professor Smith says that reducing methane emissions will lower levels in the atmosphere relatively quickly (decades), whereas carbon emissions have a delay (centuries), and Kip also says at some point that 51% of all greenhouse gas emissions are caused by livestock. The greed that's even prevalent in environmental activists is frankly disappointing.

<br><Hr>
I think you put that very well. The main problem is a cultural one here in America. I am from the Netherlands and I see the same problem over there. People want to change as long as it doesn’t affect their daily lives and even then, a five minute shower less is fine but once you try to affect their eating patterns they get defensive. This documentary does a great job of showing how capitalism works. Whenever there are large amounts of money at stake people tend to protect their assets instead of doing the morally right thing. All the big initiatives are intertwined with one another and helping each other gain  as much weight as possible. Nobody wants to be the odd one out by saying that livestock is the biggest problem. But watch them be the first to advocate it once a change in pattern is inevitable.




<br><Hr>
I agree with this statement so much! Food waste is such an overbearing issue that can have easily accessible solutions if only we invested in resources to prevent it. This documentary really highlighted that issue and I was left feeling angry that we (as in America) hoard so much wealth but can't spare much money to alleviating these issues? We have the wealth, but we don't have the priorities.



<br><Hr>

I wholeheartedly agree with your enjoyment of the interviews and how they managed to paint out for the viewer how corrupt and unjust the American government is when concerning the agriculture and meat industry, in specific their role in averting our attention from what actually occurs behind closed doors in these corporations. It frustrates me to hear within the documentary how European countries of equal development as ourselves are working on reducing the 90% food waste and extremely high levels of methane within our atmosphere while our government simultaneously drops out of COP 21 and more or less refuses to accept the reality of climate change. This leads straight into your statement about wealth. If countries that practically model their economy after the one that we have are able to spend enough money to initiate these climate saving protocols, then why is the United States, arguably considered the biggest monetary powerhouse in the world, sitting around and not doing anything to help the cause?

Cowspiracy was a very eye opening documentary focused around the idea that people need to turn their attention to the animal industry and the effect it has on the environment. Although Kip Andersen tends to exaggerate his facts to add dramatic effect to his points, he successfully made a film that is effectively stating that even if every American tried to be more energy and environmentally efficient, due to animal agriculture, every time we eat meat, eggs or dairy we are helping add to the constantly worsening catastrophe of killing the earth. To prove his point he discredited most of the individual environmental solutions such as driving electric cars, taking shorter showers, and eating organic foods because they will not solve the main issues such as global warming, loss of water, and the protection of land. Anderson's point is that he believes if people want to make a positive change for the environment then they should stop eating meat, dairy, and eggs. Animal agriculture uses 55 percent of the water in the United States because to make just 1 gallon of milk and 1 pound of beef it takes three thousand and five hundred gallons of water compared to American homes which only use five percent of all water usage in America. So through the concrete facts and personal reflections of Anderson,  he was very effective at getting the point across as his target audience was to everyone whether they are concerned about the issue or not but especially those in America who kill 144 million animals everyday for food because this is a solution that is feasible and manageable by all. 
<br><br>
My general reaction to the film was I was shocked by the facts that animal agriculture is responsible for 15 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions which is two percent higher than all forms of air, land, and ocean transportation combined. As someone who tends to lean towards eating vegan and vegetarian meals, I really wish that the knowledge about the effects of animal agriculture was more mainstream and the focus of individual environmentalism, but as the son of a dairy and meat farmer I see both sides. I do believe though that if fifty percent of Americans ate a mostly vegan or vegetarian lifestyle the rate of global warming and loss of water would go down drastically. I think this is an idea that is worth sharing and letting people know because everyone is being affected by every cow that is being killed and burger that is made to be eaten. I would recommend this to a friend but also encourage individual research as the movie was very biased and had some factual errors.

The film Cowspiracy has opened my eyes towards the truths about the meat industry. What really caught my attention was that nobody was really addressing the issue that animal agriculture was the main cause of this. What got me really mad was when I saw that the nun Dorothy stang, the American nun who spoke against the cattle industry, was gunned down and that 1,100 activists had also been killed. How can people go out to kill others just for profit.This is so awful. I can’t even try to explain how much I hate the meat industry as this point. And then the animals, the fact that not only do they kill the poor animals to feed people, but as a consequence of even growing them, they have killed other species like elephants and wolves. These species do not deserve to get their land taken away or to be killed just to expand land for animal agriculture. These species have the same right as humans to live on earth. Ultimately why not stop eating meat? As the film addressed, a plant-based diet is sustainable and we can thrive eating plants. We have to let go of meat no matter what, we cannot let this continue because if we do we will just promote more suffering and that is just not fair.

I did not like how the film was overdramatizing the issues and the fact that Anderson built his argument using some incorrect facts. I did not realize that there was so many controversies with the information given in the film. For instance, it is pretty shocking for the real fact to be 15% of greenhouse emissions are from farm based agriculture rather than the 51% that they claim. This makes me dismiss this film and make the film ineffective. In addition, I felt that this film was fueled more by how Anderson felt towards this issue rather than just presenting the facts. There were times where I felt the narrator was somewhat shaming the audience for not living a vegan lifestyle. I think that this film would have been more effective if it was shown in a more objective way. However, one thing I felt the film did well was how they were able to display how dangerous the industry of animal agriculture is by their interviews, especially the ones that show how little the government cared about global warming related issues.  
<br><br>

I think anyone that eats meat should watch this film. This film definitely connects with the audience on an emotional level.For instance, making the audience feel guilty when the duck’s head was cut off to have people see the animals as beings rather than just food.
<br><br>

I liked how the film provided solutions in the end. By being vegan you could reduce your carbon footprint by 20lbs, making the Paris Agreement of each person producing no more than 2 tons of CO2 much more doable. It was pretty interesting for Professor Ken to bring up the concept of being a “freegan”. If I’m being honest, I don’t think that eating discarded food is an issue and feel that people should do that. For example, my friends and I always help one another finished their leftovers. It is a very practical way to not waste food.

I would agree to your comment. I was actually very surprised when they first mentioned that animal agriculture causes 51% of the greenhouse gases. I was thinking about how this could be possible, since other climate organizations all focus that emissions from housing and transportation are the highest contributors. Now, learning that it was actually only 15%, and Anderson gave a severely incorrect statistic, I am very shocked and concerned. If Cowspiracy was chosen to be the #1 film for this week, this would mean that it is one of the most impactful animal agriculture. I know that this statistic of 51% is one of the more important and memorable statistics from this documentary for me, and I believe it is probably the same for others. The fact that the narrator was purposefully misleading the audience seems unjust to me. I understand that animal agriculture does have a big impact for carbon emissions and that we should all work to decrease these emissions. However, I believe the audience should be presented the correct statistics and facts to give them enough information in making their decision. 
<br><br>
I do think that, like you said, the film ended off on a good note by presenting that going vegan will decrease carbon footprint by 20lbs, is a significantly big impact. This fact alone would probably persuade people who care about the environment to try going vegan and feel that going vegan actually has an impact. 
<br><br>
If the fact of a misleading statistic was put aside, I think that this film was actually a good introduction to showing the harmfulness of animal agriculture on the climate, and gives a good reason to why so many movements are calling for people to go vegan.

Cowspiracy is a good movie for people who doesn’t know much about the agricultural aspect of climate change. It shows that besides the direct opposition the climate scientists and environmentalists face from the climate change deniers, there is a whole other group of people that lurking underneath the mask of “environmental organizations” and intentionally (or forced by the agricultural industry) hiding information from the public. It is really frustrating to see that the people who got interviewed kept avoiding to say something about agriculture. This movie can certainly make people wonder, “what can we really trust on the issue of climate change”.
 <br><br>
  However I do feel a little uncomfortable (if not a little provoked) after watching this movie. I wondered that of course grass fed cow farms will be worse if people are going to eat the same amount of food, and I thought the main cause of the deforestation in Amazon Rainforest, which is to satisfy agricultural need, is common knowledge. The fact that the author arrives at a conclusion of “go vegan, no more meat” after all these incidents is too simplistic, and it really made me to search online to check the information on Cowspiracy.
 <br><br>
  As Ken notes, the agricultural sector is responsible for 15% of the total carbon emission, not 51%, and I actually found it out online after watching the movie. This is a critical mistake, as it tends to make the entire movie questionable despite its good message (and even if other information is correct, people will still be skeptical about it, and it is ironic because the movie might make people more skeptic about all these environmental organizations, or even climate change itself).
  <br><br>
 The note on “you cannot be an environmentalist if you eat meat” is particularly troublesome.
<br><br>
As a global issue, such a claim is targeted towards everyone. From what I can see, people who still live in a “hunter-gatherer” society (e.g. tribes) eat meat too, aren’t they environmentalists? They are keeping the peace of the land by keeping the balance of nature, not by giving up eating meat, and what contributes to the climate crisis is not because we all eat meat (I mean we started eating meat tens of thousands of years ago), but because we have done it too excessively. This growing population has thrown the nature off balance (while every other organism is following the rules of nature); the huge amount of livestock has thrown the nature off balance. We have controlled the nature in a way that satisfies our boundless need and we need to stop. Does giving up meat on Monday help? I would say unless you eat more meat on the other six days of the week to “compensate” what you have “lost”, it will definitely help, and I don’t think that discrediting a small step is a good way to get people in the right track.

I went into Cowspiracy expecting it to tell us how terrible livestock is for the planet and why we need to change.  And it did just that... and more.   I was not expecting for the filmmaker to show the corruption of organizations that I thought were on our side.  This movie shed light on the fact that multiple different industries leave livestock at the bottom of their list of priorities because of donations from the livestock industry itself.  I found this truly shocking because I know my parents on multiple occasions have donated to environmental organizations and it makes me wonder if they were donating to people that truly have saving the planet in their best interests.  The film films numbers are shocking or at least until Ken revealed to me that the director actually used false statistics in the film.  To me this destroys the importance of this film because if I were on the other side I would feel tricked if I found out that I was coerced to stop eating meat with false facts.  I truly believe that the agriculture and livestock industry is a true problem, but this movie is not helping the cause by putting fake facts out there.  Climate change deniers exploit this persuading to the audience not to listen to anything that Climate Crisis supporters have to say about the livestock industry because of one movie with their facts wrong.

The movie "Wasted" explores how and why 1.3 billion tonnes of food waste is being thrown away. Learning that 60% of the cauliflower is a leaf that gets thrown out, despite being tasty and edible made me so sad. There are so many parts of plants that we don’t eat, which is so bad because not only are farmers not being paid for all of their products, it also has a negative effect on the environment. Like one of the interviewees said, we should utilize all parts of the plants in the farm, just like we utilize all parts of the animals out of respect for the animal. Furthermore, a lot of the food that we don't want to eat could be given to animals. The United Nations estimated that if we fed waste to pigs instead of the corn/soy mix, we could liberate enough food to feed 3 billion people. Considering how in America, one of the world’s wealthiest nations, 1 in 5 kids don’t have enough to eat, this could be a game changer. Another big problem is overfishing. For every pound of shrimp caught, up to 6 pounds of other species are discarded. Because of the new ways that people fish, bycatch is very common and harmful because we are just throwing away these animals for no reason except convenience, which is very selfish. To add to all of this, humans have destroyed 10% of the Earth’s wilderness in the past 20 years. Nature requires crop rotation and nutrients that are taken when we overuse the land. Because of this, composting is important. Composting is the process of breaking down organic matter and transforming it into nutrient rich soil. If we composted our food scraps, we could help ensure that the land and what grows in it is able to thrive.

This movie also got me excited about next year because, after watching people shop at the Daily Table, all I want to do is learn how to cook and make healthy foods. I signed up for CalFresh and now I feel like I have more of a means of eating healthy food because it is essentially free for me to buy it. I also liked how Ken talked about what a Freegan is in the introduction video. I think that it is such a smart lifestyle considering how much food is wasted and how it not only is bad for the environment but it would help people who are food insecure.

I watched this film knowing what would be the outcome, and that outcome I selfishly don’t like. This outcome is the decision that I should probably go vegan. At the beginning of this course I learned how bad beef is for the environment, but now watching this film I now also know that all livestock isn’t sustainable. I love my eggs, the occasional hamburger, and philly cheese steak, which is why I started small by trying to eat less meat this quarter by eating vegetarian 2-3 days a week. Now I know that I need to do more since so much of our environment is being taken to be used for raising cattle. Even grass fed beef is not sustainable for the environment and actually has a larger footprint than factory farming. By going vegan this saves: “average of  1100 gal of water, 45 lbs of grain, 30 sq ft forest, 10 lbs CO2, 1 animal life”. This will make me feel good about my lifestyle and from what I hear that it is totally healthy. I’ve been taught to make sure I always finish my meat and drink all my milk so that I can grow up to be big and strong one day. Now, I need to unlearn that and find new sources of protein that don't involve animals. As an athlete I’m worried about my performance and building muscle if I change my protein intake. Does anyone have any suggestions for high sources of plant based protein?

A lot of us probably feel guilty about our dietary choices after watching this documentary. Personally, I was also raised on a very carnivorous diet, and growing up as an athlete as well, I really needed that protein. I hadn’t been very educated or informed about protein and the variety of ways to meet the daily intake until last quarter when I took a nutrition class. We learned that there are complete or incomplete proteins. Meat counts as a complete protein while legumes, grains, nuts and seeds count as incomplete. When you combine two or more incomplete proteins, it provides you with all the nutrients you would get from a complete protein. So, if you were to eat beans and rice, that would count as a complete protein. A lot of people don’t know about the different sources and how it is actually a lot easier to get your protein intake satisfied than you think. The average american, actually consumes way over the suggested amount for protein, due to our high meat diets. So you might be overconsuming protein and not even knowing it. All these sources of protein contribute to the fact that we could produce 15 times as much plant based protein as animal based protein on the same plot of land. 
   <br><br>
At the same time I was taking this nutrition class, I was also in ES 1 where we were  studying the climate and I was learning a lot about all the benefits of switching to a plant based diet. Because of this, I decided to go vegetarian at the beginning of fall quarter. This is something I could never see myself doing just 6 months ago. I was the person who always said “Oh, I could never give up meat,” but after learning so much about the impact the animal agriculture industry has on our environment, I got past the idea that I could never be vegetarian and I just did it. I am still working on becoming vegan and eating an entirely plant based diet, but that is taking time and I think it is okay to work slowly and gradually so that you eventually get to a point where you can give it up more easily. 
  <br><br>
 This documentary really makes us want to think about our food choices and change them. Just the fact that a vegan diet requires 18 times less land than that of the average american meat-based diet is crazy to think about and we could be using that extra land to feed more people who are food insecure and starving. When the film mentioned that instead of using the grains  grown to feed starving children in developing countries, 50% of the grains we grow is being fed to livestock in order to produce meat and animal based products for developed countries like the US, I felt awful. Kids are literally starving to death in order for us to be able to over consume meat. 
  <br><br>
 It is so important to know about the information presented in this film and even more important to take action on it. We all have a way of improving our carbon footprint and we can all do so by living on a plant based diet. I asked my parents and younger brother, who eat a largely meat-based diet, to watch this film and I hope that they take out of it what I did and start to think about the way they eat, not only for the sake of our planet, but also for their health.



<br><hr>
Thank you for answering my question! I didn’t know about how there are different proteins. I think why I struggled to go vegetarian is because I wasn’t eating the right combination of incomplete proteins. I need to do some more research and since you’ve mentioned it I’m thinking about taking a nutrition class to attain more knowledge. I’m excited to continue my journey to becoming a vegetarian and eventually a vegan.

The director uses a really special view to indicate one of the most horrible environmental secret in the world which is animal husbandry, and he uses different kinds of outcomes to indicate the ponderance of this issue.
  <br><br>
I think the people who are casual viewers might be the film’s audience because when we see this title, we will feel curious and will not figure out what the real topic of the film is. Also, the aims of this film must want to introduce how serious overgrazing is and tell more people who have never notice about.Firstly, I thought overgrazing is not that kind of serious and I think it will only affect little things such as grass. However. Gradually, I found that it was much more serious than I thought, and I was emotionally moved by the horrible outcomes of overgrazing. I have never known about overgrazing relating to the soil, the atmosphere, and even the oceans which are almost our earth. Of course, I learnt how serious overgrazing is and how it relates to the destroying of our earth. After watching it, I feel optimistic because I think more people taking action after watching this. For me, I will try to notice more news about grazing. It likely that I would recommend to my friends because milk is one of the most important food in our daily lives, so I will tell them how serious overgrazing is and try to learn these kinds of news more.

While we now all know consuming animal products is one of the largest causes of increasing CO2 emission on our planet after watching this film, we have to admit it’s extremely hard to convince every single person in this world to change their diet habit. For instance, I’m a person who enjoys having beef and chicken for my meals, and I would definitely get depressed if someone forced me to be a vegetarian. Hence, instead of removing all animal products from our table, we should have a “milder” solution, or at least do it step by step: people can try to decrease the proportion that animal products take in their daily meals, which means they can still eat beef or chicken, but just try to eat less and also they should avoid wasting. I consider this as a more acceptable way for most people in this world compared to forcing them to become vegetarians. Animal agriculture is a problem without any doubt, but the government should not put this burden on those civilians whose lives rely on animal agriculture. It’s unfair to make them take the responsibility or blandly ban what they depend on for living because today’s climate crisis is caused by human beings as a whole, not those raising livestocks.

In the United States, one-third of food is not eaten, and this part of food is called waste. In particular, 90% of the waste goes to landfill. However, it is not a sustainable way. All the food can be used, and there should be no waste. The film "Wasted" highlights existing food that can sustain all the people in the world if we properly treat "waste". The film divides waste into four parts. The first one is to feed people. The film mentions all the parts of a plant are useful. Not only the leaf but also the stem can be eaten. Also, the film points out there is a huge waste of bread in England, and a person comes out an idea which is to utilize the "waste" to make beer. The waste replaces almost one-third of wheat used by the industry to produce beer. The second part is to feed animals. For instance, pigs can eat this waste. The third part is to make compost which is a key material to enrich the soil. The last step is to landfill. 
      <br><br>
 Program Drawdown also underscores that reduce waste is a significant way to mitigate the climate crisis. It expresses that both low-income and high-income countries are wasting food. Low-income countries waste food unintentionally, because the infrastructure to store and distribute the food is not advanced. High-income countries waste food intentionally since people will reject food if the food is bruised, bumped, or colored.

This is the reason that I decided I should try to be vegan. I honestly didn't really care about the animals themselves, I had seen farms and while their treatment of animals was awful, it was the bigger impact that really hit home. I wasn’t surprised that 34 trillion gallons of water are used for agriculture. But, I was surprised at the ineffectiveness of keeping that knowledge a secret. If changing the way I commute and live makes barely a dent, why is that what has been drilled into my head? Because it’s “Water management vs behavior change.” I had never thought of it this way, but it’s true. Managing a problem is much easier than changing the source of it. It requires bandaids instead of heavy duty tools. Though it may be exaggerated, the fact that 51% of greenhouse gases are from agriculture is enough to bring it to the forefront of problem solving. Even if it was 18 or 30%, that’s on the same level as transportation. It should be given an equal slice of focus.

I thought it was interesting that when he talked to the farmers they said that if your land can’t sustain beef production, you shouldn't be eating it. This could make sense, except how could you go backwards? How could you reverse the globalization of meat and food products? You probably can’t. 
      <br><br>


I wasn’t surprised to see that the amount of land to support a meat eating family was 18x that of a vegan diet. I was also shocked to learn that we were producing enough meat to feed billions more people than we have in the world now, yet there are still starving populations across the globe. It showed that it’s not only a problem with agriculture, it’s an issue with the way people interact and live.

In the film, Dr. Richard Oppenlander stated that “fishing of any type is depleting not only the species but you get into this serial depletion where one fish species will be minimized and the fishing industry for that fishery will move onto the next species”. But we’ve been fishing as long as our own species has been alive. It’s fishing at the rate we fish that depletes the species. It’s OVERFISHING that depletes the species. It’s the tragedy of the commons, or the depletion of public resources because of self-interest. Fish can reproduce even if we are fishing -- we just need to give it that time to reproduce. That just means fishing less and fishing responsibly. Think about food waste! It’s the #3 problem on the “Summary of Solutions” from Project Drawdown! The project states that “a third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or factory to fork.” Food waste is not just a personal problem. It’s a problem with the storage, processing, and transporting of food at the corporate level. We fish more than we need! We just don’t understand that. That’s evident in this movie. We think that the only option is to stop fishing completely -- or ban it -- because if not we will continue fishing irresponsibly. Who’s to say that that’s true? If we gave fish that time to reproduce by fishing more sustainably, fish would continue to thrive. Every animal, in a sense, is meant to be eaten. The food cycle is an important part of the life cycle, and we are a part of that food cycle. We are simply exploiting it and destroying it. Every organism is a predator and every animal is a prey. We have become very powerful predators. I’m not saying this is good, because clearly it hasn’t been; with power comes responsibility and we’re not being responsible. We need to learn to fish, eat, and live responsibly!

I totally agree with you. I found the sections about the fishing industry to be the most striking to me, mainly because I have heard all about the beef industry, and very rarely hear about fishing. Even when I am working on cutting out meat, I fail to include sushi (stupid, I know) because it is something I eat so infrequently, and love so much. This entire documentary broke my heart (I couldn’t watch the scene where he kills the duck) but it was particularly awful hearing about all the animals that get caught in fishing nets and are just needlessly killed (dolphins, sharks, and WHALES). I also appreciated how you brought up food waste. It makes me think about how many lives are wasted as well in the entire food industry. Not just the sharks and dolphins and whales, and all the animals we eat like pigs, cows, and chickens, but also animals like bobcats, coyotes, foxes, etc. The killing of predators is so disgusting. Anyone who has ever taken any class about ecology knows that our ecosystems cannot exist without predators, but predators also can’t go unchecked. Humans are the biggest predator in the world and we are going unchecked.


<br><hr>

I agree with your approach to fishing. I have a family member who is pescatarian, meaning the only meat she eats is fish, and she claims she is doing it to take a stand against animal cruelty and to help the climate crisis. While, yes, she isn't eating land animals like cows and chickens who are cruelly murdered, she is taking part in an industry that is very destructive to the environment. The killing of non-targeted fish is detrimental to the natural ocean ecosystem. Not only is it killing the targeted fish, the prey, but it is also killing the predators, the sharks. According to the film, millions of sharks are killed each year due to bycatch. This completely disrupts the environment, as we are decreasing two different sections of the food chain, and that's not even to mention all the other accidental casualties that are caused from big fishing.

      <br><br>

I thought that my family member would have known everything about the issue she is taking a stand against. Nobody else in my family has changed their diet to remove meat products, but we do all eat fish, which makes it easy to cook just one meal for family dinners. This is why I am hesitant to tell her the truth about the fishing industry, about how it is just as bad as the meat industry. Because nobody else in my family has completely removed meat from their diets, it is unlikely we will remove fish in our diets if I expose this truth to them. If my pescatarian family member decides to become fully vegan or vegetarian, it would mean we would have to prepare two different meals, which would be very inconvenient. 
      <br><br>


I think that inconvenience is a big reason why people aren't talking about the fishing industry. People think that they are doing good for the environment by eating fish, so the people who know the truth do not want to be the bearers of bad news.



<br><hr>

You point out that we are part of the food cycle. I think too many people think of humans as separate from nature, which results in a kind of disconnect when we talk about saving the environment. People think being eco-friendly is a selfless was to be, but in fact by saving our planet we are saving ourselves. 

      <br><br>

I also want to comment on the idea of banning fishing altogether as was suggested in the film. As you say, it is overfishing that is the problem. What we need are limits on industrial fishing, as indigenous communities have been sustainably fishing for thousands of years. When we think of solutions for problems like overfishing, we must think too about the social implications. By banning fishing, we would take away a vital part of their livelihood a major food source for many indigenous communities who have nothing to do with the larger problem of overfishing.

The film “Cowspiracy” was probably my least favorite film to watch that was assigned by Ken if i'm being honest. I found it quite boring and repetitive. Just the fact that Anderson kept trying to speak to these organizations about the agriculture issue and they kept either blowing him off or attempting to talk their way around the conversation to avoid the issue, was pretty annoying. I understand that, that was Andersons point - he was trying to show us that agriculture production is a potent issue when mitigating the climate crisis, yet it is constantly ignored and he was attempting to figure out why this wasn't getting the attention that it deserves. But after constant scenes of him getting blown off started to bore me. Also, when Ken mentioned that some of Anderson’s statistics were quite off, such as agriculture production only accounts for 15% of greenhouse gas emissions and not 51% like Anderson showed us, made me question how trustworthy the film actually is. But obviously Ken wouldn't assign us to watch this film if it wasn't important. So nevertheless, the film did teach me stuff that I wasn't aware of such as 100billion gallons of water a year is used for fracking while 34trillion gallons of water a year is used for raising livestock. This difference in the amount of water is huge! Just goes to show how incredibly water intensive meat and dairy products are. Or when they showed the statistics that over 1,100 activists have been killed in the last 20 years in Brazil, one of them being Sister Dorothy Stang who was a U.S. American born nun that was murdered for speaking out against cattle ranching is not only devastating but quite scary - makes one not want to speak up about these issues which is the opposite of what should be occurring because we must speak about these issues in order for change to occur.

I agree that this video was quite repetitive with asking the asking of questions and the continuous ignoring of these questions. The thing I find most annoying is that his statistics were not correct but he kept saying the main cause of many things was animal agriculture when in fact it was only 15% and not 51% like he told some people. He made these people seem like they were just ignoring the question when in reality they had never heard this statistic because it was not true. This makes me question what else in the documentary was not true and if he just lied throughout the whole thing. Just because this documentary doesn’t give facts doesn’t mean that animal agriculture does not have a huge impact on the Earth, it just made me feel like it was exaggerated to make people feel bad.
      <br><br>


I also felt like this documentary was basically saying if you don’t go vegan you aren’t helping at all. When they said you can’t be an environmentalist without going vegan it really made me upset because many people can not afford the vegan lifestyle. In smaller cities being vegan is much harder and even in bigger cities, veganism is an expensive change. Many people have to feed their whole family and cannot afford to change their diet. If vegan food was cheaper and more accessible I would feel different about this but at the moment it’s neither of those things.


<br><hr>
I agree with you that Cowspiracy was not only repetitive but also boring in comparison to other climate change documentaries. I had known that Anderson's other movie, "What the Health," was inaccurate in some of the facts claimed. Therefore, I was confused why Ken would give us a documentary that had inaccurate depictions of the issues of climate change. After watching his video talking about it, I was assured that he recognized the inaccuracies of the movie.
<br><hr>
This film is boring and repetitive regarding its content. I agree with you about how you describe this film. I was shocked when Anderson says that 51 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions come from the production agriculture. It sounds absurd to me. Personally, I do not think that the agricultural industry will cause that much wastes each year, especially when he talks about animal agriculture. People's lives depend on those things. If there is no agriculture industry then how are we suppose to sustain ourselves? Anderson was trying to do the right things, however, I do not think that the agriculture industry will cost that much of the effects on the environment. There are way more unnecessary productions that are damaging the environment. But agriculture is essential to humanity, and agriculture has existed on earth since the beginning of humanity. As Ken said that agriculture contributes to 15 percent of the greenhouse emission and I think that it can be easily solved. 
      <br><br>


It is true people need to reduce emissions for agriculture, but those emissions are not so significant. And with modern technology, I believe that many problems can be easily solved for the agriculture industry. In recent years, organic vegetables become a huge trend, but organic vegetables are much expensive. 
      <br><br>


And in the end, I also found it radical on the data of the death of the activists. We do need people to speak up, but the way of how to speak up is important.
<br><hr>
I also found this film a really hard one to watch. It's really disappointing to watch someone represent an issue so badly when it's an issue that is so important. I personally can forgive people for using incorrect statistics in documentary or research, given they correct it adequately and apologize for their inaccuracy, but Anderson's mistakes were unforgivable. The first half of the film REVOLVED around his incorrect numbers. The faux-ignorance act that DiCaprio pulls off decently in his film was obnoxious and amateurish here, ESPECIALLY since his arguments were based on a false premise. 

      <br><br>

The thing is, I really liked parts of the film! It was effective at pushing me once again in the direction of full veganism... So I'm really disappointed that Anderson does his argument so much damage.

      <br><br>

Yuchen Rhen commented with regards to agriculture that "those emissions are not so significant. And with modern technology, I believe that many problems can be easily solved". I strongly disagree with that viewpoint - I think this will be a huge and painful shift, and I think that blatant errors are going to make the shift even harder.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you this film was annoyingly repetitive. As you said this repetition is only part of rhetoric but just watching the same story over and over and over again annoyed to the point that I was just turned off by his message. Also, now that Ken has pointed out that his data was incorrect, I feel like his credibility is tarnished. It’s not like he barely mentioned the incorrect fact that 50% of global greenhouse emissions are from the livestock agriculture industry, this is something that is reiterated throughout the film. Now it is more obvious as to why these organizations were in shock by the numbers he was presenting. However, with there are very positive messages from this film. We need to consume less dairy plain and simple. We also need to be more sustainable with it, just because the numbers were off doesn’t take away from the fact that the dairy industry still negatively impacts are environment. Although I don’t think this was great film ther is still a lot to learn and take away from it.

<br><hr>
I would honestly disagree with your assessment of the boring nature of the film. I think the part of what you find boring or repetitive is why this is such a big issue. I do find it uncomfortable that a large premise of this documentary is based off an incorrect statistic, however, I think it was the best way to portray that no one would talk to him about this important issue, and that even prominent environmental organizations, regardless of his false stats, haven’t put the massive environmental damage that this industry causes at the forefront of their policies, especially toward deforestation. This documentary, I will agree, however, is generally of poor quality and seems poorly researched, though it aims to make a heavy point about the environmental impacts of our animal agribusiness.

 I felt pretty conflicted when they mentioned you couldn't be an environmentalist without going vegan. As we already know, switching to a plant based diet is no doubt more beneficial to our earth than consuming meat - but, if you choose not to for whatever means, doesn't automatically mean you dont care for our environment. Like you said, not everyone can afford to change their diet. Recently I’ve been on yelp scoping out food menus from a variety of restaurants, just out of my own curiosity, and started to compare the prices from their regular menu and their vegan alternatives. First thing I noticed is that there aren't a lot of plant-based options to choose from which I don't quite understand considering how veganism isn't rare; their entree options with meat were endless compared to without meat. Also, many of their options consisted of mainly salads, soups, and vegan burgers - they were very repetitive. The second thing I noticed was how pricey their vegan alternatives were compared to a non vegan meal. Getting a vegan burger was more expensive than a regular burger and purchasing a salad was more expensive than either one. Obviously, preparing a meal at home is cheaper than eating out but I just found it interesting comparing the two when it comes to eating out.

Offering what is easily one of the most radical takes on the climate crisis, the film Cowspiracy gives an outright rejection of the premise that change from within agricultural organizations that cause pollution can lead to a reduction of said pollution. Organic food does not mean less food wasted, Short showers won't save the water supply, eco-friendly lumber won't save the rainforest. At the very root of the agricultural and food production industry is high waist and low cost: two seemingly different factors that contribute to a positive feedback loop sending environmental areas into ruin. It is just a fact that it takes a thousand gallons of water to make one gallon of milk, so the consumer should take shorter showers but still put cheese on everything. It is just a fact that ramen should cost 50 cents, so in order to keep it cheap it is right for the producers to destroy millions of acres of rainforest yet continue to advocate against the horrible lumber industry. What this movie tells the consumer is that the food industry is so entrenched against being environmentally that at this point it isn't going to change: they have already so fundamentally altered the mindset of the consumer. But what can change is the consumers actions: veganism in particular. By making a choice to reject the products offered, the industry will be forced by economic forces to stop its harmful ways. This rejection of the industry by the consumer is stand alone in its power, but, at least as the movie portrays it to be, it can be very very powerful.

I strongly believe that Kip Anderson should have checked his facts before putting them into movie form because even though, yes it does scare the viewers into listening, it also plants new doubt in the information being given to them. Scaring them into listening is not an adequate way to get our points across, he could have had a great movie if he had fact checked himself. How can he go after the environmental orgs with false information and still expect us and them to believe what he is saying. It seems very misleading. Maybe Anderson didn't know that his information was false, but even so if you're going to be making a film about exposing the truth, maybe you should actually speak the truth instead of exaggerating. Or maybe he did know the truth and wanted to use fake information to knowingly make the situation seem worse than it is, either way its still not a great look for him. I'll admit that its a compelling film even after knowing that his facts were not all true, but just knowing that climate deniers will take any inconsistency and run with it makes me not support this film much because it shows a weak link in our fight to convince others of the perils we truly do face. If they see a fallacy in our argument they will be quick to dismiss our entire movement which is not the move we want to be making. I think there could have been better ways to make this movie have a stronger impact, and honestly if he had just spent the extra time making sure all his facts were true then I would totally have supported Cowspiracy fully.

Within the film Wasted, pointed out that the average american family spends $1500 on wasted food a year. The fact that over 1.3 billion tons of food just going to waste really left me in such utter shock. One of the main things that stood out to me was how many people throw out certain foods because of these best by dates, use by codes, etc. For a consumer that’s extremely confusing, whenever I had gone grocery shopping with my family I would always look at the best by dates on milk and other foods, and when I saw that the milk haad gone over the best by date by about a day, I immediately went to the sink to dump it out. But before I could get to it, my mother stopped me and said , “smell it first before you throw it away,” in which I did and it didn’t smell bad, but I was extremely confused on why they have these best by dates if they weren’t going to expire. Until the film pointed out that the supermarkets use these codes to rotate in production. Just even that, the amount of food most of these supermarkets toss out is impeccable. However, I also know a supermarket in my hometown that instead of tossing out the food that they donate all of it to our local food bank. That’s perhaps an alternate solution other super markets should pick up on rather than throwing out the food.

If those involved in the climate crisis cannot come to an agreement or acknowledge what causes the most greenhouse gas emissions, I feel like those at Heartland or the climate crisis skeptics would just eat this up and use it to their advantage. They are already delusional from the existence of climate change that watching Cowspiracy would only add to their unbelief because there are so many topics regarding climate change that are in disagreement. 
      <br><br>

I feel discouraged after watching the documentary. Maybe I’m just being pessimistic but as I take English 23 and learn about climate change and its cause and what we can do stop it, I’m reminded that there are so many aspects to climate change and it's not just the emissions from coal, natural gas, or fracking. There’s land agriculture (as we’ve seen from the doc) and there’s also the ocean (acidification, fishing, and pollution) and there’s also the emissions from humans. 
      <br><br>

It baffles me that over 1100 activists are killed for speaking up with almost no media coverage in Brazil alone (at least I haven’t read anything or have seen an article about it). It’s crazy that the expansion of land agriculture caused by corporate greed is destroying the lungs of the earth. We are the lung cancers of the earth. 
      <br><br>

Even huge organizations like Greenpeace and the Sierra Club “do not have opinions” or are not educated in that area when it is a huge part of our daily lives. The former director can now say that the main issue is in front of their eyes and yet they do not speak about it, who are we to trust or get the information from?

“You can't be an environmentalist and eat animal products, period” Howard Lyman calls it an addiction and the metaphor relates to the cow business; from a broader view, the industry is money-hungry with no regard for the earth or morals while from a more narrow view, there are people who refuse to give up meat because it “tastes better” than vegetables. I can name a couple of foods and dishes that do not have any meat in it at all but taste so much better than meat. It isn’t hard but our society is so used to eating and seeing huge meat selections in huge markets.

While I don’t believe it is ethical to kill animals for food, it’s a very strong aspect of Brazilian culture. Every family get-together is an excuse to have a ‘churrasco’, a traditional barbecue. It’s ingrained in the blood of nearly all Brazilians. However, we do need to re-evaluate our meat consumption, especially how much we are producing, the ecosystems we are killing to be able to meet the demands of the market, and how we can improve this process as to waste less food, since there are millions of hungry people in the world while only a small portion of people have access to food. I don’t believe it’s possible to completely eradicate meat consumption, neither do I want that to happen because it’s part of my background, but I do believe we need to reevaluate how we are consuming animal products because we are doing it in a very unsustainable manner.

The film Cowspiracy definitely addresses critical flaws in America's animal agriculture sector. However, some of the ways that Kip Anderson went about investigating this sector appeared to be a bit counterproductive in my opinion. I didn't really like the fact that he was manipulating interviews with leading climate activist groups to try and "expose" them for ignoring the problems that animal agriculture presents, especially when his main statistic of 51% was wrong. Obviously, the climate groups are trying to make efforts to reduce human's destruction on our planet and I don't think criticizing their efforts using a false statistic was very beneficial to anyone. With this being said, I do still believe that Americans in specific need to change our eating habits. In my opinion, there is no reason that one person should be entitled to 9oz of beef a day. Although I think that eating meat is not necessarily the worst thing that one can do, I definitely think that the sheer amount needs to be reduced. I also find it important to realize that there is almost 8 billion people on the earth at the moment that need to be fed, so without these major agricultural industries using fertilizers and GMOS, I don't see the food demand being met. Like Ken has mentioned in lecture before, eating plant based but not voting to elect people who will stop things like fracking essentially negates the methane that an individual saves on a personal level.  Ultimately, it is important to adjust one's lifestyle in a  multitude of ways to live more sustainable, however I still see attention to politicians environmental views as the most important way to stop harm from lobbyists and create infrastructural change towards a cleaner America.

I’m going to be brutally honest, I hated this film. Not only did I fall asleep on my first attempt watching it, I woke up to the part where the living duck had its head chopped off. The next day I decided to watch the film over again, giving it a second chance, and I was extremely bored. This is officially the worst film we’ve had to watch so far. The first thing that I didn’t like about the film was the camera work; the shots were poor quality with a bad filter. The second thing I wasn’t impressed by was Anderson’s tactic to interrogate companies and organizations about the issues of agriculture. I understand now that agriculture has a large impact on climate change, but there was no reason for him to talk down about the organizations and businesses that weren’t willing to agree with his claims. The third thing that upset me was hearing Ken say that Anderson’s facts were incorrect. I no longer take Anderson or this film as credible and I think he made a joke out of himself by lying to the viewers. 
      <br><br>

Unlike Before the Flood, Fire in Paradise, and The True Costs, this film has left me feeling nothing. I stand corrected, I was happy when the film was over. The other films made me question my consumption and behavior, but Cowspiracy didn’t make me more or less inclined to stick with my diet. The large difference between livestock causing 51% of greenhouse gas emissions and livestock actually only producing 15% of emissions makes me question the whole validity of the film. Is animal agriculture the leading cause of climate change? If this film is invalid, why would Netflix support it?

The statistics presented by “Cowspiracy” completely shocked me. They were so much more detrimental than I could’ve ever guessed or imagined, and that is what truly shocks me. The fact  that I had not even the slightest clue about how much water it takes to produce a pound of beef  for consumption is startling because there must be so many others just like me. At this point in the climate crisis, walking around uneducated and making decisions that may be as mundane as eating a cheeseburger is unacceptable and extremely detrimental to the fate of our planet. The amount of burgers consumed in the United States per year is around 50 billion. That’s absurd! So much of our natural resources have to go into producing this food just so that we can stop at McDonald’s for a Big Mac. One quarter pound hamburger came from the use of about 660 gallons of water; no burger is worth that amount, just saying. The worst part is, however, that no one knows this. We all blindly walk into a restaurant and order a burger or a steak or whatever kind of meat without even considering any negative effects. This documentary was so educational and eye-opening for me because these hard facts are impossible to deny. For example, to learn that animal agriculture causes the rapid deforestation of one acre per second is simply unbelievable. These terrible effects on our world definitely encourage me to head in a more plant-based direction, and if others educated themselves on this topic, I think they would be convinced as well.

I definitely resonate with your feeling of shock, as many of the statistics presented in the film “Cowspiracy” are hard to grasp. Like you said, there are so many aspects of animal agriculture that we fail to recognize in our daily lives. As I am already a vegetarian, I know that I am already doing a lot to lessen my individual carbon footprint. However, after watching this film, I realize that there’s more that I can do; knowing just how many resources are consumed in production of animal products makes me feel motivated to become vegan. While I know this may be a challenging feat for people who eat meat daily, I feel as if it is my responsibility to do my full part: ridding my life of animal products entirely.
      <br><br>

Like you mentioned, the documentary was truly eye-opening and shocking. As Ken talked about in his video, some of the statistics in the film are wrong. However, regardless of the accuracy of the percentages, animal agriculture truly does have an immense impact on the global carbon footprint. Additionally, the horror of animal agriculture is so hard to watch, which is why it’s important to keep ethics in mind when we choose what we eat; no statistics can convince me that the animal agriculture industry isn’t horrifying and unethical. Even with varying statistics regarding the severity of animal agriculture’s impact on the climate, we still need to make changes to our food consumption; switching to a largely plant-based diet, among other things, is a great step in the right direction.

 I too was shocked by many of the facts shared in the film "Cowspiracy," especially the fact that you are shared regarding the 660 gallons of water that it takes to produce just a quarter pound hamburger. To me, it is hard to even truly imagine just how much water is going into such a small amount of food, especially when you consider that it is something completely unnecessary for humans to consume. It is truly saddening that such a large amount of one of our most vital natural resources, fresh water, is going into such a needless industry.


In addition to the excessive water use associated with animal agriculture, it's other environmental effects, including deforestation as you mention, truly stood out to me as well. For example, in regards to the emissions of animal agriculture, the film states that it produces 65% of the world's Nitrous Oxide, which causes global warming at a rate 296 times that of Carbon Dioxide. In my opinion, the fact that such a powerful greenhouse gas is primarily given off by this single source is very alarming, and it is not something that I had ever heard before watching the documentary. I believe that this ignorance to the environmental degradation caused by animal agriculture is one of the main reasons why many, if not most, humans continue to eat diets so high in meat. If a person knew all the water that went into making their burger, the emissions created by it's production, the land needed to raise the cow it came from,  as well as the countless other sources of environmental destruction it causes, they would surely think twice before eating it. That is why I think anyone who is interested in stopping their consumption of meat should watch "Cowspiracy," as it lays out this information in a clear and entertaining way, even if Kip gets a few figures wrong during the film.

The vegetarians in the documentary are arrogant about the world. First, we are arrogant about the earth. There are only millions of years of human beings who have mastered modern technology for only a few hundred years, and who have realized environmental problems for only a few decades. We believe that we have mastered the development law of the earth for 4.6 billion years, and that we can save the earth by doing so? Human beings can't even understand their own history, so they can decide how to do better for the earth? All they have done is for the sake of human beings. The earth never needs anyone's help. The earth doesn't care about environmental pollution, greenhouse effect, desertification, sea-level rise and other issues. The earth is the earth. Even if a madman launches a nuclear bomb the next day and destroys all living things on the earth, the earth still exists. The earth already exists 4.6 billion We are confident that we will live longer than human beings. We don't need anyone's help. To think that we need to save the earth is to think that we are above the earth. That's really disrespect for the earth.

Second, he is arrogant to all other people. At the end of the film, the director can't help but say the truth. We must live a moral vegetarian life. The director thinks that vegetarians are more moral and full of superiority. Are these truths not self-evident: everyone is born equal, and the creator gives them a number of inalienable rights, including the right to life, freedom and the pursuit of happiness. Until some people are vegetarian and tell us that it's happier and more moral? I believe that everyone has the right to choose their own life. No one can stand on the high ground of morality and ask others to follow his morality. Maybe the 1 billion hungry people in the world who may not have eaten meat do not know that it is immoral to eat meat for them. Of course, some people will say that you consume more resources when eating meat. Why do we vegetarians pay for you? I think this is "democracy". If more than half of the world's seven billion people choose to eat meat and are washed away by the flood, then ask vegetarians to prepare their own Noah's ark, because people have the right to choose to fall and destroy, even God can't save them.

I think it's interesting that the Declaration of Independence mentioned the pursuit of happiness as an unalienable right, but does not mention happiness as one. In other words, you have the right to look for happiness all you want, but you are never guaranteed to find it. Throughout the years, Americans have looked for happiness in different places, and I think the American Dream is what they thought was the epitome of it. If you had a job, a house, a car, and a family, you had it all. But that didn't satisfy us for long. In modern society, happiness is defined more and more by materialistic possessions. It's what we've learned previously in this course: people will buy stuff that will temporarily make them happy, and give them the illusion that their life is good, but the joy will fade, and they'll find other ways to satisfy themselves. In the film they talk about extrinsic and intrinsic goals, and I think society is currently obsessed with extrinsic goals: money, success, etc., instead of focusing on what matters: internal peace and satisfaction. Until we learn to live without the fear of being judged, I don't think we will pursue true happiness.
